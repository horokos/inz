I have sex maybe once a year right now.

Which is NOT how things usually are for me.) \n\nI am blessed with an amazing loving spouse + partners who, while they can't understand why I'm dead from the neck down, have never given me an ounce of shit about it, but I wouldn't blame them if they did. The difference seems to be that I'm still into regular makeouts and I still hold them when they want to get off with me, I just don't really participate except sometimes verbally. I do as much as I can because I want to be close to and intimate with the people I love. I'm also kinky, and I can top bondage and such without being horny, so there's that. And it is getting better -- I went to sex therapy for a while, I read and write erotica, and I'm trying the injectable lady-viagra soon too.

I would totally understand if this was a deal-breaker, but I think it matters that I'm trying and that I try to participate in intimacy in other ways too. I want my people to know that I love them and I do find them attractive and that my body is just not playing ball.

The big difference it that it's a lot less obvious where someone really is.\n\nIt's also important not to conflate Ethical Non Monogamy with Polyamory. Polyamory is loving multiple people. Ethical Non Monogamy can mean a lot of different things, though it does contain polyamory. Kinda like how \"Bi\" is an umbrella.\n\nSome people like the idea of sex with multiple people, or the idea of romance, but very few people can actually maintain a real relationship with more than one person, and that's not even getting into the fact that jealousy is something that is a thing a LOT of people struggle with.\n\nIt should be something that is entered into with full enthusiastic consent from both parties, and if one is trying to force the other into it, that's an enormous red flag, and chances are the relationship isn't a good one. Think of it like kink, and because it's something that can really hurt people, think of it like both parties agreeing to trying Masochism.

It's unrealistic to expect my spouse to be everything I need to satisfy me, as I'm wired differently from most. I've personally found solace in having a supportive community, but it all hinges on communication.\n\nFor instance, this weekend my spouse is attending The Witches Ball, an event I opted out of. They're spending the weekend with a friend in the same Airbnb. If they return as a couple, I would be delighted by the incredible energy between them. Meanwhile, I have a date with an amazing person I recently met.

Wade \"my body, my choice,\" I truly embraced it; no one else can dictate what I do with my body. \n\nNon-monogamy isn't primarily about sex for me; in fact, I've had fewer sexual partners than I did when I was monogamous.

When I'm experiencing mental distress, you must take it as seriously as my spouse would if I reached out to them.

Our ideas that we shouldn't be dating people of different age is also discussed.\n\nSome take-aways I have so far from the book.\n\nAge is an attribute assigned by our society to an individual. There is an assumption that the years they've spent since birth coresponds to their characteristics, such as physical properties, inteligence, ability to consent, financial status etc.  Based on this assumption, we organize our current societies and rules. Who should protect, and who should be protected.\n\nHow true are these assumptions? Can these assumption have violent outcome? What about those that do not fit in the assumption, the norm.\n\nThere are many interesting discussions involved in the book, including how age-based organization of the society masks more fundamental structure of dominance, such as ablism, racism, and westerncentrism, and reduces it in this myth of sacred childhood, or belief that everyone in our societies have a more-or-less similar ability. We infantilize people with diabilities to justify our ablist system, because you know, \"age is universally true, a real biological attribute\".But is it?\n\nAt the end of the day, you are only going to get a reddit advise saying you'll have a better time dating people of similar age. This advise is based on the assumption that similar age reduces your risk of being in a relationship with a steaper power dynamics.\n\nIs this true? Maybe. Maybe not.\n\nDisclaimer: This is obviously not to say that violence isn't common in different aged relationships.  But we don't blame the survivors, and the violence is likely not caused by age, but rather difference in financial power, access to material and social resources, and other abilities.

I'd love to feel all the feels.\n\nHere's one of mine.  \nIt was just after graduating high school, just after breaking up with my boyfriend, just after coming out as gay. I felt so free and happy and ready to \\~be gay and do crime\\~.  \nMy grandma lived in Brazil, and I went to visit her for a month (I'm from a western European country, one part of my family is Brazilian). She lived in a tiny, sleepy seaside town, kind of a retirement village, only a bumpy dirt road connecting it to the nearest bigger town. I had a wonderful time with her and the locals, but I did feel a bit giddy and restless, so I downloaded tinder and selected \"women only\". God, that made my heart race!  \nI soon matched with a wonderful butch lesbian around my age. She lived a town over, and after texting for a day or so, I asked her if she wanted to hang out (I pulled the \"I'm new here, can you show me around?\" card). We agreed to meet at the bridge that leads to the beach. I was there first. She pulled over in her little silver car and got out, with a dazzling smile and that beautiful dishevelled short hair that I think only butch lesbians can achieve. She'd brought a bottle of red wine and a blanket, and we made our way to the beach. It was completely empty that evening, and we sat down, started out with some slightly awkward small-talk in a mixture of Portuguese and English and smoked menthol cigarettes. I was feeling brave and slightly tipsy, and I really fancied her, so I asked her to go for a swim with me. She said that she hadn't brought her swimsuit - but I was fully feeling my carefree holiday self and said that she could just wear her underwear! Before she could say anything else I'd taken off my clothes - I was wearing a bikini underneath - and run into the waves. She undressed and follwed me. We giggled and laughed and swam, and, lo and behold, after a few minutes she swam towards me and we kissed in the waves. She held me so tightly and I wrapped my legs around her and it felt just so good.  \nWe met again the next evening; she picked me up at my grandma's house, drove me back to her place, we held hands over the gear shift and listened to the radio, and then, back at her place, I experienced my firt time with a woman. It was the best sex of my life, The Road to El Dorado was playing in the back, and I went completely tingly and numb in my limbs. The next morning, she kissed me and made me breakfast in bed.  \nIt was \"just\" a holiday fling, but it was also the best first gay experience I could've ever asked for.

I don't know what the musical's cast and crew were up to, probably tormenting an IHOP waitress with the giggliest, most sugar-rushed rendition of If I Were a Bell ever heard, which is saying something, but the pit band had all decided to have an after party at a trumpet player's house. \n\nI'm the type of girl when asked about, people shrug, avoid eye contact and go \"well, she's... nice...\" and speaking of avoiding eye contact, very obviously autistic. People don't invite me places, 'cause I'm just going to stand there in the corner and when asked if I'm okay I'll manage an \"oh no, I'm fine\", just sucking the life out of any and every room I'm in. So, much to my shock, someone in the band asks me if I'm coming to the after party. And when I say someone in the band, I mean Lydia (not her real name).\n\nThere was this one day a year prior to this story where we had just stopped in at a Starbucks in Los Angeles during our big out-of-state band tour. I was sitting by myself at a table on the patio beside the building. Lydia comes up to me to chat. She was the type who'd chat with every person in a given space. I didn't know if it was out of the love of friendship or if she just liked the sound of her own voice. She could talk a lot. She sat across from me at the table. We talked for a little while. I don't remember what we talked about. I really wish I did. And then she puts her chin in the palm of her hand, tilts her head, smiles and sighs-- \"you're so interesting, you know that?\"\nI have no idea if she was being genuine, if she was mocking me, if she was hinting, sarcastically, that she wanted to talk about something else or what. I don't know what sort of dark magic she put in that line but I was crazy about her after that.\n\nSo. All of us pit band kids go to the after party. Like I said, I don't get invited to parties, so I am trying my hardest to be normal and friendly and cheerful and bright and I had no idea what I was doing and it was very bright and loud and stressful and no, um, sorry, I don't really want to play Just Dance-- so I stepped out onto the porch where it was quiet. Cool. Just a little rainy. The guy who invited us to his house lived up on the hill overlooking the city, its lights glimmering like the sea under moonlight. Finally tranquil. I check my phone, it's about midnight. I wonder if I should go back in and tell the host I was supposed to be home by now. No, no, maybe home by one or something so I don't cause problems. I sit there for another minute, listening to the patter of the rain on the deck and the rumble of the party inside.\n\nThe door to the porch opens. God, I think, I bet it's Abby, asking if I can be their fourth player in a game of Cards Against Humanity, or maybe Michael asking if I saw where he put his keys, I need to act normal again-- no. It's Lydia.\nShe slinks out and sits down next to me and asks quietly if I'm doing okay. I say yeah, I'm just a little overwhelmed, and she says it's okay. She asks if she can stay out with me for a minute. Being as it's a nice night (maybe a little damp) and my crush is sitting right next to me, I say yes. Again. I don't remember what we talked about really, there was something about some of the other kids at school and then some of the music we liked.\n\nAnd then at some point she turns towards me and just stares. I'm thinking, uh, what? I try to stare too, my hatred of eye-contact finding refuge in the boldness it takes to stare unblinkingly at someone. She smiles a little. She grabs me. She kisses me. \nIt's the least passionate, least enjoyable kiss I can imagine. It's dry and awkward and her fingernails are digging into my cheek and I can't really move and the kiss itself lasts under two seconds. It's perfect. \nLydia says \"Sorry. I've always wanted to do that.\" \nI didn't ask what \"that\" was. Kiss a girl? Why right now? Kiss someone by surprise? Why me of all people? Kiss the weird, silent girl to see her response? The response is silence.\n\n...I probably wouldn't have got a straight answer if I had asked, because Lydia was distracted within seconds by a car rushing past, far above what I assume the neighborhood's speed limit was, saying something about how she bet he has just like, committed a burglary and was now rushing away, any second now we'd hear sirens, it'd be on the news, I don't know. It was the sort of whimsical rambling other kids playfully reprimanded her for. It was music to me.\nAnd I guess all my audacity from our little staring contest earlier was gone, because as much, as deeply, as desperately as I wanted to ask her to kiss me again, I couldn't muster up the courage. But I was just okay with sitting there and listening to her talk to herself, with me occasionally trying to add something meaningful, and her acting like I'd just said something groundbreaking. \n\nShe then checked her phone and realized how late it was and she got up and said she needed to leave. I said okay, I followed her inside as she said her goodbyes to the remaining kids. When we reached the front door she said we'd \"continue this on Monday\". It was a Saturday night (or early Sunday morning, if you will). Monday is the most brutal day of the week and 7:30 the most brutal time on the clock. And there I was, dreading being away from school tomorrow and dreaming of what could possible happen on Monday at 7:30 when school started and I'd get to see her again. The day we'd continue things.

And because I\u2019m a medical student, and also insufferably ~~bossy~~ a boss, I can\u2019t not get on my soapbox for a moment, so here I go! For the vast majority of women, douching is a waste of money at best. It\u2019s often much worse than that, causing disruption of the vaginal microbiome and pH, irritation to the skin in that area including internally, stripping of the normal mucus/moisture, all of which paves the way for infections. I\u2019m glad you enjoy this product and you and your partner aren\u2019t having any issues, I\u2019m not going to tell you to stop! but I do feel I have to say my piece for any other vagina pilots reading this who were unaware and who are inspired to start douching. \n\nThe skin inside your vagina is cellularly/molecularly *similar* to your normal external skin, but has some important differences. One of them being that the cells that make up the outermost layer of skin on eg your forearm or ur favorite asscheek are filled with tough keratin and form an impermeable barrier, whereas the outermost skin cell layer of the vagina contains lots of glycogen instead, and is permeable. Another is that the vaginal epithelium contains Bartholin glands that produce the natural vaginal lubricant. If you care to read about in greater detail, this is a good deep dive into the histology: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4024347/  And here\u2019s a paper detailing a literature review of the evidence about the practice of douching, its benefits/risks/harms: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2567125/ The takehome point I\u2019m emphasizing is that the vaginal mucosa runs its own very unique very tight ship, and generally does not appreciate our attempts to micromanage its self-cleaning, self-maintaining processes. Even products that purport to be \u201cgentle\u201d \u201cnatural\u201d \u201csupport your body\u2019s natural flora\u201d \u201cpH balancing\u201d - those are all just advertising words. Douching sells women the notion that this really biochemically sophisticated, self-cleaning, self-regulating part of their body is actually dirty and should not be left to its own devices, and you need to buy things to clean it. It\u2019s like this weird sexism-themed, germophobic-adjacent attitude? Like some kind of fundamental discomfort with letting natural, complex, biological living systems just be. It strikes me as akin to feeling like you need to \u201ccleanse\u201d your garden of all that dirt. \n\nIf you\u2019re someone who deals with chronic/recurrent bacterial vaginosis or yeast infections, and you\u2019ve finally landed on a regimen that helps to treat/prevent/mitigate these, which includes douching or boric acid suppositories or whatever - my soapbox rant is not about that! That shit can get so complicated and frustrating, and there\u2019s so much lengthy trial and error along with pain and discomfort - you have only my utmost sympathy! My unsolicited monologue is really about the relentless endeavor of capitalism to do the precise opposite of \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d to every square micrometer of women\u2019s bodies, minds, and souls.\n\nthank 4 come to ted talk", "ups": 21, "depth": 1, "author": "bottom-ramen-80085", "replies": [{"selftext": "This is exactly where my brain goes when people mention feminine washes.

Not taking people\u2019s feelings into account, but also treating them as a mere instrument.\u201d\n\nObjectification exists as a potential for all forms of attraction. That is the biggest hurdle for men who have fallen prey to misogynistic attitudes when pursuing women romantically: society positions women\u2019s romantic reciprocity as something to be won, not given; owed, not earned; transactional and formulaic. Objectification ultimately strips the object (in this case women) of their agency.\n\nSubjectification, however, takes agency into account inherently. The subject has action, personality, relatability; and exists as a whole being. (The two links go into more specifics)\n\nSo, after taking subjectivity into account, there are correct answers to these questions. The correct answers are the ones that minimize harm (objectification is dehumanization, a form of harm). \n\n1) Is it ok to be sexually attracted to a random woman in public?\n&gt; Yes. Ones attraction is not inherently harmful. As long as the subject of attraction is treated with empathy and their emotions are treated as equal to one\u2019s\u2019 own when interacting with them, there is no issue.\n\n2) Is it ok to be sexually attracted to women you know in real life?\n&gt; The answer to 1 applies here as well. Random women in public become women you know in real life. \n\n3) Is it ok to masturbate to the thought of women you know in real life?\n&gt; Yes. Again, sexualizing \u2260 objectifying. Sexual attraction is no different from other forms of attraction. Your fantasies are not reality, and thoughts are not inherently harmful. Thoughts and attraction are inalienable parts of a person\u2019s agency: we are free to think, feel, and love. \n&gt; \n&gt; That would be like asking \u201cis it okay to imagine a future where you\u2019re married to women you know\u201d. Both are boundary crossing to mention out of the blue to random women you know, but fantasies themselves are a potential part of attraction. We don\u2019t treat preexisting fantasies as some taboo topic ***after*** mutual attraction has been established, so we shouldn\u2019t do the same for just *having* fantasies about subjects of your attraction.\n\n4) Is it ok to masturbate to social media pictures of women you know in real life?\n&gt; My answer here also covers my answer to 6 and is related to my answer to 3: \n&gt; \n&gt; This is explained in the subjectivity link, but zooming in on parts of someone\u2019s body is objectification. You are cutting out the person and looking at parts of them like a piece of meat. However, if the image itself is expressly of the subject focusing on a particular part of their body, that is not objectification: the subject has invited you to focus on a part of themselves. As long as you don\u2019t make your attraction their problem there isn\u2019t an issue. \n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, taking into account the entire picture shared by a person ***of themselves*** is not objectifying. You would be merely using a visual aid for the fantasies mentioned in 3. \n\n5) Is it ok to comment on women\u2019s attractiveness to your friends?\n&gt; Talking about your attraction is not inherently harmful, being objectifying in your language (like: \u201comg, she\u2019s so hot look at her [body part]\u201d) would be. \n\n6) Is it ok to comment on women\u2019s body parts to your friends?\n&gt; with everything up to this point being said: comments are not made in a vacuum.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can subjectively talk about a person\u2019s appearance and their appearance includes their body. Mentioning their body along with the rest of their appearance is subjectifying. They have agency over what they adorn themselves with and talking about how a look flatters/highlights/flaunts parts of their body isn\u2019t inherently harmful. \n\n7) Is it ok to ask women out in public places?\n&gt; Yes, as long as you take their agency into account and are respectful in your approach. There\u2019s no harm in expressing your attraction and seeing if the subject of your attraction is interested.\n\n8) Is it ok to ask out women who work with you (if you are not their client or in a position of power)?\n&gt; This might be a hot take, but as long as adequate rapport (the threshold for adequate increasing with the level of power imbalance) has been established there should be no issue with expressing attraction with a work contact. \n\n9) Is it ok to positively comment on a random woman\u2019s appearance to her?\n&gt; See answers to 5, 6, and 7\n\n\nHope this helps.

The way you word things is so interesting and using actual psychology/philosophy to convey those points makes them so much more strong like i feel like you could talk me into jumping off a bridge and i would get convinced lmaooooooooo. Really love this answer. Also I am fascinated how you just have, not just the name of a professional regarding this up your sleeves, but also definitions and distinctions. It's honestly so cool. Also how concise you are like I took fucking paras to convey the same points you did in my comment hahahahahahah\n\nAnd everything you said I agree with. It all makes sense logically and morally. Like to just having thoughts and feelings isn't bad (in general pls dont hit me with some specific edge case) inherently, it is more so the intentions and actions that change how good or bad they are. Forgetting they are real humans with their own feelings and freedoms, is the biggest marked difference between when your intention/action is good or not, for these questions\n\nIt's all normal if you treat it how you would treat a normal convo where you order a cup of coffee or tell your friends a joke. But if you start disregarding their emotions, are unable to take any rejection without being pushy at best or coercive at worst, only think of them in terms of a reward you gain something from, and make them feel unlistened, then it is bad. If you avoid those, then in general it is good\n\nSome people might misinterpret them, but because yk its easier to talk about these things in theory in isolation, but irl there are so many other factors, like how they are feeling that day or what their past experiences have been or how they have seen you act around others or just the vibes of the situation or even their own bad intentions/actions, that also play into why someone might reject you or be upset with a seemingly-innocent compliment\n\nBut they have the full right to. Whatever they reason they misinterpret it or don't accept it, that's just the explanation, it isn't some new quest for you to fix, because the primary priority truth is that they are unwilling, and that is that, sucks but you have to swallow it and accept it and try to treat them in a way that doesn't upset or harm them. Even when you are just thinking about them in your room, that concept still applies, that if your thoughts were to ever come true, you would be respectful and listen to them\n\nBecause at the end of the day, everyone wants to be and deserves to be happy. And if you ruin that in any way, which objectification often does since it reduces them from being their own person/identity down to just being what they can sexually offer, then it sucks and you suck and thats that\n\nAnyway, yeah, I really enjoyed your comment and also tag me any next time you just dish out psychology/philosophy like that, just tag me lol because I am super interested in knowing about those things. OH ALSO YEAH, your answer to (3) and the ones related to that question, I fully agree with you logically but don't vibe with them. I don't have any strict reason as to why not, they make sense and are completely okay if done respectfully. And like if someone tells me they do that regarding someone they know, I wouldnt think lesser of them for doing so yk. But myself, I wont. It gives me weird chesty vibes in a way that I don't feel comfortable doing so myself. But thats just me, I wont judge someone else for doing it and feeling differently than me about it\n\nBut yeah you are not wrong, a sexual fantasy isn't any different from a wedding fantasy or some Tintin-style adventure fantasy, and in fact treating sexual emotions as something weirder or bizzarer than other emotions is a not-so-good mindset that can lead to a lot of unhealthy views regarding sex. Plus, things don't exist in isolation. It is not necessary you think of them as weirder than other emotions, but you were taught that growing up due to conservatism or religion, so your morals go against your feelings about sexual expressions. At least that is what I think is the case with me, and might be for many too. Things aren't ever simple or uncomplicated, are they lol?  \n\n\nAs long as morally you respect their freedom and emotions, and are willing to put that freedom first over whatever hesitant feelings you may get in your chest, then it should be alright, you wont be a bad person\n\ni DO have a question about one thing though, to end this very long reply with lol. It is regarding your answer to (4). You say that zooming in one someone's body part is objectification and hence bad, but thinking of themselves as a whole with just added focus on one body part you are attracted to is not objectification and is okay. Which makes sense, when put like that. I see the point and I agree. But it is only clear from this direction, how about the opposite. Sure, once you say the explanation of what is good and what isnt, then it is easy to extract examples for them to better illustrate your definitions. But in reality, in practice, all you have is the example, then how do you connect them with the definitions, as in, if you feel a certain way about someone's body part, how do you work it out backwards if the way you are feeling is objectifying them or not, and is bad or not?\n\nLike with eyes or hair, they are easier examples since they aren't socially sexualised (as much). But if I like someone's butt, for example, how do I realise that my liking of that isnt objectifying the person but is just a factor amongst many about why I like them as a person?

They are just a natural part of being human, and often are uncontrollable. It doesn't say anything wrong about you if you feel attraction like that to strangers in public. What matters is how you act on them. You could even approach them, in a nice way. There are bad ways to do it, and any way where you don't respect them or take their feelings/perspective of the situation into account, is a bad way. But just feeling the feelings? I think that's completely alright  \n\n\n\n(2) Yes. Usually feelings are messy. It would be SO easy if real life worked like a romcom where you just fell in love on the first sight and got married by the first date lol. Not how it usually works irl. Usually it takes time for you to get to know someone, till you start developing feelings about them, and it isnt always easy to figure out how you feel about them, because how you feel can manifest itself in SO MANY different ways, including feeling sexual attraction to them. That is part of falling for someone, at least if you are not on the ace spectrum. And again, it is often beyond your control, and often part of other messy feelings towards them and whatnot. Just because it is sexual doesn't make it creepy. There are respectful ways to think about someone sexually, and to still treat them as a normal person no matter how you feel about them. And yeah often, that sexual attraction could just be part of a bigger process of you falling for someone yk. And I don't think falling for someone is bad, the heart wants what the heart wants  \n\n\n\n(3) Hmm, here I am kinda hesitant about. I don't have any OBJECTIVE answers to why it is wrong, but it just kinda feels wrong yk? Feels like too much. I personally won't feel right doing it, not without talking to them first regarding it. But I actually have asked this same question to some friends who have sometimes tried to convince/console me that it isn't wrong. So I suppose it is a divisive question. Personally, I find it bit weird, just something about it doesnt sit right with my instincts, even though the logic part of my brain can't really argue against it. But I do realise it can be weird to hear from a friend \"Hey I touch myself thinking about you\" lol  \n\n\n\n(4) I think my answer would be the same as (3), but also there is an extra element of weirdness attached to it because its like,,,,,i doubt they posted those pics thinking that \"oh yeah people will touch themselves to this\" yk? For them it could be innocent pics of nice times, and to turn that into a sexual thing, to me yeah no feels a bit weird again. But if you dont find (3) weird, I dont think this would be much weirder   \n\n\n\n(5) Yea. Completely, but again the general rule is, be respectful. Remember you are talking about a real human being, treat them as one and take their feelings into consideration when you talk about them. Generally, don't say something about others that you wouldn't like others to say about you. But as long as you are respectful, then YES, big yes, it is kinda healthy too, ngl. It is a bonding thing too with friends and lets them know you better, and you feel more comfortable being open with them yk?  \n\n\n\n(6) This REALLY depends on the way you do it. Saying \"Oh she has big thighs i wanna ride them\" is bad and also very bad. But saying \"She has soft hair and I want to run my fingers through them\" is not as bad. Those are just extreme examples but yeah the same body part/trait can be talked about in weird ways and sweet ways, doesnt matter if it is a sexualised body part/trait or not. Again, be respectful and considerate, that's always the general theme. It is fine to like some body parts a lot, like for example, I really like hair. Some women really like eyes. Some really like hands. Etc. That is fine, and thinking someone has pretty eyes is fine, unless if you make it weird  \n\n\n\n(7) Yes, again, be respectful. I feel like a broken record repeating that lmaoooooooooo. It's completely fine, as long as you don't make them feel forced. Like they have the right to say no. They have a right to say yes too, but it is THEIR own right, not yours, you cant coerce them to say yes, or restrict their possibilities of saying no. She shouldn't feel cornered or threatened or at risk (physically or socially like humiliation) in any manner. Other than that, yeah sure go for it. I cant say all women will take it well, maybe some would be appalled at you for doing so, but in general the concept isnt bad, approaching someone isnt bad  \n\n\n\n(8) Same as (7). Yes, but yeah, there should NOT be any power imbalance. And it should not put their job at risk or anything. It can be very complicated though and sometimes is against HR rules, so please take those into consideration as well. Don't go into work LOOKING to find someone to date, but if you are at work and just HAPPEN to meet someone and vibed with them and started to develop feelings and they do too, then in general it isnt a bad thing to date, barring power imbalance or risks or even HR rules lol. But yeah dont go to work thinking it is a dating app, it is not. This is slightly divisive a question too, some people feel no about this, some feel yes. If that woman you want to ask out feels no about it, respect her opinion  \n\n\n\n(9) YES. Do refer back to (5), (6), and (7). But as long as you follow the guidelines from those answers, then omg YES i even ENCOURAGE you too. It's a really nice thing and may make someone's day. If you can, try to make the compliment more specific, like \"Oh you have a nice fashion sense\" or \"Your smile is really cute\", rather than a general \"You look good\". The latter is fine too, just that the former tends to work better and makes them feel nicer. If you can, maybe compliment something they do or put effort into, so they feel good about their efforts and decision, and feel noticed and appreciated", "ups": 5, "depth": 0, "author": "Lesbihun", "replies": [{"selftext": "Wtf how do i put spaces in between the points it feels so messy like this\n\nEdit: nvm figured it out by accident lol.

Yes, but **don't tell anyone about it**\n\n-5. Potentially, but best to stay broad and complimentary (e.g. \"she's gorgeous\"). Don't say anything you don't want the person, your mom, and the local newspaper hearing)\n\n-6. Potentially, as long as you're not being mean or gross. As with anything you say, keep in mind your intended audience, and the likely unintended audience. Again, stay complimentary. Better to remark on something you know she's worked hard on/cultivated intentionally (e.g. better to praise her biceps than her boobs), but still don't be gross.\n\n-7. Why not? As long as you're not doing anything else to make her uncomfortable or like physically/socially cornering her.\n\n-8. I don't think it's morally wrong, but it is foolish and risky to date someone at work. It **is** morally wrong to pursue a relationship with a subordinate\n\n-9.

But it could make things awkward between you and her later if you do and don't have the best pokerface.\n\n4) Same as #3.\n\n5) I mean it depends on what you say and on other aspects of the context. \"Wow that waitress was really hot~\" to a friend after lunch is different from some more explicitly sexual comment (what you'd like to do to her, what you imagine doing to her, etc)--*especially* where the woman in question can hear you, though in general talking about specific sex acts with people who have shown zero interest in you is getting into \"gross\" territory. But just saying you like someone or find them attractive isn't weird. You're allowed to find people attractive. \n\n6) Talking about which specific parts of them you find hot can get iffy, but I dunno, I don't think \"she has the most amazing long legs\" is like weird or gross or anything? It's more, \"I want to toss them over my shoulders\" that's getting back into \"gross\" territory when there's zero indication that she even likes you back. It also kind of depends on the kind of friendship you have, if it's the kind of friendship where you'd tell specifics of what you find attractive in general, sex you've had in the past, how you masturbate, etc, it's less weird than if you're just purely doing it to objectify someone.\n\n7) If you're in a situation where you have a meet cute and sparks are flying and there's chemistry, yeah, go for it. But in general, I don't think it's good to just go up to random women with the intention of getting them to date you--knowing absolutely nothing about them, not knowing their orientation, their relationship status, if they just put their dog down 20 minutes ago. There's a difference between just organically meeting a stranger and having a conversation, and going out of your way to approach women you don't know. The latter is basically harassment. It would be better to get into more social situations where you would actually be talking and interacting with people, some of them women, so you can get to know someone before you ask them out. If you don't know their orientation or relationship status yet, you have no business asking them out.\n\n8) Sure, lots of people meet their partners through work. You should have at least some indications that they like you back first (mutual flirting, etc) and be prepared to be professional about it if they say no or it doesn't work out.\n\n9) I think the general rule is that if it's something she chose about her appearance (her hair dye/style, how her makeup is done, her nail art, her outfit, her shoes, her purse, etc) compliments are fine as long as you don't do it while leering or in a suggestive tone of voice, but aspects of her appearance that aren't so voluntary (her height, her curviness, her pretty face, the shape of her ass, etc) don't say it. (Aspects of bodies that were probably worked for intentionally, like having absolutely shredded abs, are a gray area. That would depend more on context and how you come off, risky.) Compliments can feel creepy or they can just be nice, and it really depends on how the person is coming off, too. One major difference is that someone who gives a genuine compliment will just go on their way without expecting more from the exchange, while someone who's being creepy is often using that as an opening line but expects to continue the interaction from there. Almost like they think the woman owes them something for the compliment. Trying to use a compliment as an opener for flirting might work sometimes, but I don't think you should try to flirt with people who are literally just walking down the street living their lives, like if there's a possibility this person is busy and doesn't have time to talk to you, don't try to flirt with them, that's just irritating. Compliments that *aren't* attempts to flirt and aren't about the woman's body are perfectly fine.\n\n10) As in literally see that women have bodies and those bodies have parts? You'd have to blindfold yourself to avoid it, so obviously it's fine. Subtly noticing that a woman's body is attractive? Again, pretty normal and would be hard to make yourself not do. Brazenly staring at someone's ass or tits to the point where everyone can see what you're doing and you're making people uncomfortable? Stop. Like, if a woman is wearing a very revealing outfit, you don't have to avert your eyes like she's some kind of tempting Jezebel, but you also just shouldn't be so obvious about staring that she or anyone else would notice. Like...just be normal, basically.\n\nThere are contextual situations where you can bend some of these rules. Certain adult venues (bars, clubs) may have atmospheres where you can be more direct about finding people attractive. If you're literally at some kind of sex party, it may be appropriate to tell a stranger she has beautiful breasts. Something like lustful staring could be *really creepy* in a lot of contexts, but if you already have some kind of flirtation/chemistry going with someone it could just be a way of making her feel desired. Most women are sexual beings, and it isn't that they *never* want to be sexualized by anyone, but they want to live their lives and exist without constantly being godmoded as a character in someone else's sexual fantasy. Women like to *participate in their own sexualization*, thank you very much. Some of that requires being able to feel out the chemistry to make a good call on whether a sexual advance is welcome or creepy. (Despite what incels say, it's not based on how attractive you are, it's based on how much *that particular woman is into it with you in particular*. Which may have some correlation with attractiveness but that's certainly not the entirety of it, and attractive people don't have carte blanche to creep on women.) A lot of people make bad calls because their horny brains want the girl to like them more than she actually does. Or because they (as women) have been creeped on so many times they just don't want to make someone else feel that way so they don't follow their instincts and take chances. If you're unsure, you could do something smaller to feel out the chemistry better before you take risks. \n\nYou have other options if the situation is ambiguous--you could drop hints that you'd welcome an advance from *her*, or you could also wait and see if she drops a stronger hint for you. If she wants your attention, that isn't entirely passive--women who *want* attention work to get it. Women who aren't going out of their way to get your attention probably just don't want it.\n\nIf you think, \"oh, but that woman is about to walk out of my life forever, I need to seize the moment!\" No, she's walking out of your life forever because she either isn't looking for a partner, or saw you and didn't go \"omg, we must meet.\" Let her go. If she felt the same about you, she might be giving you some lingering looks or finding excuses to stick around. If you're getting absolutely nothing, that is not an invitation to remind her again how much you think of her sexually.\n\nBasically, women should be able to exist in the world without constantly getting pounced on and reminded that they exist for the sexual gratification of others. But that doesn't mean women never want to date or have sex or that flirtation isn't a normal and healthy thing for humans to do.\n\nAnd no, this stuff isn't significantly different if it's gay or straight. I don't want random women swooping up and asking me out when I'm just trying to go to the ATM or buy groceries either. Once or twice would be a novelty, if they did it as much as men do it would be exactly as irritating. Some women also get that \"I'm a girl so nothing I do is creepy\" thing where they do stuff that's like 20x more creepy than what most men would dare attempt, like grabbing another woman's breasts or pinching her ass?

{"post": {"title": "\"Lurked\" at her twt account TOO much and saw some Things, how should I proceed??", "subreddit": "actuallesbians", "selftext": "I'm dating my current GF (we are both 21F) for the last four months. It's my first romantic relationship and so far it's been really good and I really do love her. We have spoken about our past relationships right in the beginning. She told me the closest to a relationship she ever had was with a girl, let's call her Garnet, who lived in a state nearby her, but Garnet just wanted to be intimate with her and that's it (GF's words). They never went official and they actually never really did break up, she just moved to my city and everything fizzled out. She says that our relationship is the first time she has ever loved and has ever said \"I love you\".  \nOne day when she was on her home town I was missing her a lot, and when I get like this I usually look at her tweets to remember her and get happy again. I know, that's a little bit weird and I'm not proud but I do that....However, one time I was looking at the media stuff and accidently scrolled too far....so far that I saw tweets with pics and gifs from last year from her and her ex GF that she never brought up.  \nThe tweets said some really heartfelt stuff she once told me she only had ever said to me, so I found it a little bit upsetting. However, at first glance, I thought they were for Garnet, and since she told me that what she felt for her didn't held a candle to what she feels for me, I decided to trust that information and let go. However, I have been a complete mess due to work and on a downright spiral, so in a very much NOT proud moment I decided to look again at her old tweets...I know that's Weirdo Behaviour and I'm really ashamed of that. But I did it and now I'm torn.  \nThose tweets were for a totally different girl, let's call her Amethyst. The tweets actually ranged from almost a year and they called each other GF and said I love you and etc, and the girl is actually from a whole different country. It looked really intense. And she never brought up having a LDR when she was talking about her past love life, not even remotely. I found kinda weird that a year ago she was calling a girl the love of her life and nowdays she doesn't even mention her...  \nThey don't even follow each other anymore and haven't interacted for months so what I'm feeling is not really jealousy. Her past is her past and it's ok to have past experiences. It's mostly confusion and insecurity because I feel like the informations don't match? Why would she hide that from me? But at the same time, I don't wanna assume anything. There are some things from my life that I didn't told her yet too because I felt like I wasn't ready. Maybe it's a sensitive topic that she didn't want to bring up yet. Maybe she was faking it and didn't actually like her. But all those possibilities make me a tad paranoid and wondering what does she actually thinks of me and what does she actually feels.  \nShould I wait for her to talk to me about it on her own time or should I bring it up? My therapist said I should bring it up but how would even I do that??? \"Hey, I was stalking your twitter and found out about a secret ex GF you never brought up, please explain!\". I feel so weird doing it, it feels like I'm violating something...to me even if it's a public account it still is borderline creepy as hell to be stalking like that and I don't want her to find me a creep (even if I kinda am one....aaaa). But at the same time a relationship should be full transparency and I don't want to be consumed by paranoia. ughh why should I do??  \nTL;DR: my GF didn't tell me about her seemely intense ex LDR when mentioning her past love life and now I'm torn between waiting for her to talk to me about it on her own terms and staying paranoid or mentioning to her and possibly ruining everything.  \n", "ups": 202, "permalink": "/r/actuallesbians/comments/16scgtm/lurked_at_her_twt_account_too_much_and_saw_some/", "num_comments": 28}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Tbh anything you post is public, and everyone that age should be aware of that by now.

Guys don't fit their personal tastes, and that's totally fine!   \n\n\nNow, if you see them as flaws in yourself or things that make you feel less attractive then by all means do what you can to address them.

I grew up placing more value in my goals, talents and passions and sexuality was just normal to me like it was for heterosexuals. But then when I wasn't talking about opposite gender crushes and was never attracted or gushed about them, I became the \"boring\" one very quickly. Even my cousins thought I was super lame. Once I came out, I started getting more friends and some people became really close to me and were even crushing on me. As much as I appreciate the support and love, it also made me feel like the only reason people think I'm cool is my sexuality. Being gay adds to it and people think it's \"interesting\". Makes me feel so depressed looking at some friends and realising that they would never have become this close to me had I not come out to them.\n\nEdit: some people would think I'm privileged to have people support me but I come from a homophobic society as well.

That was MY interpretation and it was absolutely bollocks. I cut my hair and it didn't affect how people thought of me one way or another - they never focused on my hair as a defining feature of who I was, it was all in my head.  \n\nAlso, people use words in unusual ways.

Honestly I won't deny, there COULD be a part of that, as a factor, on how some people treat you. There is the whole \"gay best friend\" thing some people are obsessed with, after all yk. But I don't think all your friends and cousins and people who are crushing on you are treating you this way just because of that\n\nBecause coming out is, essentially, a big thing, yk, its usually a big deep secret you have to face and fight. I am glad it hasn't been for you, don't get me wrong, you aren't weird for not feeling the need to ever come out, like if anything that is good because no one deserves to go through the horrible reality of having to hide their identity and be someone else. But in general, coming out is seen as a big thing, an admission of a really deep secret. And if you are coming out to someone, you are basically opening up to them yk, or at least it is how it is socially perceived. And that strengthens bonds, because it shows you are comfortable with them and can be vulnerable and your true self. So that could be a factor too\n\nPlus, maybe some of the people relate. They are lgbt too, and they feel a different sense of bond with you now than they did before, now that they know you are lgbt too and can understand their struggles or relate with their experiences or get their lgbt-specific jokes. Like if they are lgbt too, you coming out is like you entering their personal group yk, you are part of the same community as them. That can be a factor too\n\nThis just applies for the crushes, but just because those people admitted crushes on you now doesn't mean they never crushed on you. It just means their chances shifted. For a guy crushing on you, this could be confirmation that okay you can't be with him now since you are not attracted to men, so it would cause a change in the dynamic of him crushing on you, maybe now that he knows there is no chance, he isnt scared of admitting it. Or for a girl crushing on you, it could be a hope that at least you arent straight so they have a chance with you, and why they admit it. Ik it sounds like I am stretching it, that either way I am excusing why they would admit it, but I don't mean that is what happened, the point is the dynamic shifted, and that could shift how they feel about you or hide their feelings about you. That can be a factor as well\n\nPart of the factor could also be that you are more you now, in subtler ways, so you seem more lively and approachable. And I hope this doesn't come off the bad way, but part of the factor could also be your brain just self depreciating you. Like maybe there are people who find you cool for other reasons, but your head is just tricking you into thinking it is for your sexuality and no other reason, whereas it just could be a coincidence that some people happened to get more interested in you or got closer to you just coincidentally at the time as you came out yk. Or it might just be miscommunication or misinterpretation of their actions on your part or your personality on their part, which could add to things\n\nYou don't seem like a bad person. Ofc idk you, I cant just make claims of your character. But you could have handled this situation, this thought, in a very hostile and horrible way too, which it doesn't feel like you have. Which is a bit telling that you are probably nice and lovely. It just could be that too, that could be a factor as well, amongst any of the other things I mentioned, or maybe just something completely else entirely\n\nI am sure not all your friends and loved ones are with you just because of some social construct of coolness, but because they do find YOU cool or fun to be around. Maybe you could try approaching this topic with them, see how they react and what they respond, it could give some insight?

But some nonbinary people aren't women or men, and some might use those labels for convenience in some contexts because that's how they're treated socially, but don't identify deeply with them as an internally-held identity.\n\nNonbinary is less a third category that's on the same tier as male/man and female/woman, and more an umbrella for everything that doesn't fit neatly into those two categories, including everything that overlaps or fluctuates or is only partially in one or both categories.", "ups": 1, "depth": 5, "author": "Eugregoria", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "I'm not alone!

We have lived together for majority of our relationship and have been through so so much together. After getting engaged I\u2019m starting to think a lot more about the relationship because getting married is a big deal to me and I\u2019d prefer to only do it once. \n\nOne of the conversations we have had that I\u2019ve never really forgotten is when we have talked about if we want kids or not. Long story short I am a hard no on ever having children, and even though I do enjoy the thought of having a family it\u2019s realistically not what I want. She on the other hand started off wanted kids and has predominantly been the one to fantasize about us having a family, which I adore\u2026 but again I don\u2019t ever want to have children. We\u2019ve had several conversations about it and every time she agrees that the idea is nice but that we won\u2019t have them. I worry that she\u2019s just saying this to appease me because the very first conversation we did actually have about having kids she said she did want to have them. She even said she would carry them and has a name picked out for if she had a boy (she specifically has dreamed of having a son). There have been other scenarios where she wasn\u2019t fully honest about what she wanted or how she felt because she didn\u2019t want to impact me or how I felt\u2026 but as we begin wedding planning it\u2019s weighing heavy on my heart as I don\u2019t want to deny her something I worry she truly desires. I also want to be able to trust my future wife and I feel like this amongst the other scenarios I have mentioned leave me worried I can\u2019t trust she\u2019s being honest. \n\nHas anyone else been in a situation like this? How do I know she\u2019s being truthful about wanting kids or not? I\u2019m willing to answer any questions if needed to help clarify anything. \n\nTLDR: My gf of almost 4 years who i\u2019m not engaged to told me at the beginning of our relationship she wanted kids, but now says she doesn\u2019t after I\u2019ve made it clear I will never want them.

{"post": {"title": "Is it possible to \"change\" sexual orientation ?", "subreddit": "actuallesbians", "selftext": "Ok let me explain this title that might seem strange. In my childhood until my early teenage years I was considering myself as straight. I realized later it was because of the under representation of lesbian couples, so to me at that age being with a man was something \"normal\" and I'm not sure if I even knew other orientations existed. Then around 12 years old I started having sex ed classes once or twice a year, in which they talked about the other orientations, the trans people, etc. It made me wonder if maybe I was also attracted to girls. Around the same time I started watching more films, and quite a lot of YouTube videos \ud83d\ude05 and I realized I was having crushes on the actresses or the youtubers. So after talking with my parents and the sex Ed teacher in private, they told me I was surely big and that there was nothing wrong about it.\n\nThen during high school we had some parties of course and in from time to time I had sex with guys. I knew I was attracted to some girls who were there, but idk I didn't had the courage to make any move. \n\nIn my first year of college I moved to a flats hare as my home was a bit far from the college. I won't develop how it all went because it would be way too long, but I ended up having sex with my flatmate (she was a girl) and we became fwbs. She was my first time with a girl, so she kinda teached me some things on how to not be fully stressed when having a crush on one, how to have the courage to make a move, all kind of things. \n\nNow I've been in a very happy relationship with my current gf for just over a year. She was with me in class in college and I had (still have it though hahaha) a huge crush on her. So last year I decided to make a move and she was feeling the same. \n\nNow all of this build up to come back to the tilted question. Since almost 10 years I was considering myself as bisexual. But recently, I've been thinking about it and I realized that I don't find attractive or arousing anymore the idea of a guy fucking me. What I'm wondering now is, is it only because I'm with my gf so I feel like I'm only attracted to girls? Or is it possible that I was a lesbian from the start and I didn't realized it? But then if that was the case, why did I enjoy sex with guys? \n\nAll of this to tell you I'm very confused on what is really my sexual orientation. The only thing I'm sure about rn is I love my gf and that's enough to make me happy \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnyway I hope I explained it good enough for you to understand and hopefully some of you to explain what's happening, and sorry if there's any mistakes, English is not my first language", "ups": 27, "permalink": "/r/actuallesbians/comments/16rzq3f/is_it_possible_to_change_sexual_orientation/", "num_comments": 16}, "replies": [{"selftext": "1.

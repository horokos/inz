Psych grad here, I'd hope this is something our mental health practitioners are cognizant of - that mental health disorders are generally the result of a confluence of variables - but I'll use the social anxiety example;\n\nA kid is raised in a household where their single parent is temperamental, doesn't explain rules and tends to get angry for transgressions the kid doesn't understand. The kid has to learn how to avoid these transgressions, this comes in a few forms, first is enhanced ability to detect disapproval, second is anticipating other peoples thoughts and taking preemptive actions, third is turning the blame inwards and looking for flaws in the self.  The kid goes off to school and lacks self confidence, they get further ostracized by their peers and further look inwards, become self critical. As an adult this person ends up socially anxious, they have a pattern of learnt behavior where in every social interaction they assume the other person is negatively evaluating them, and they assume they themselves have a flaw which is being examined. In the extreme this can lead to isolation and avoidance of even mundane things like speaking to a register worker at the supermarket.\n\nIs the social anxiety justified? Absolutely. It relates to over a decade of formative, conditioned learning from a parental figure. Removed from this environment, a psychologist may work through their disorder and try to alleviate some of the cognitive distortions, because assuming everyone is negatively evaluating may not necessarily be true. However it's worth noting that like this example, very real environments and conditions bring about these issues, depression is no different. You can't treat a disorder effectively without first removing one from the environment, or alleviating the conditions that brought it about. Sometimes this can be as simple as a poor belief system which has caused you to negatively ruminate after a bad breakup, sometimes it can be an underlying condition like ADHD, ASD, schizophrenia which is severely impairing your life, sometimes it's something like abject poverty and economic turmoil which is bringing on severe depressive episodes in bipolar and throwing you into addiction.\n\nEven when something like depression or anxiety seems to come about \"spontaneously\" or \"irrationally\", you'll find it'll relate to something like thyroiditis, chronic sleep deprivation and vitamin deficiencies (IE, D3, magnesium or B12), etc.", "ups": 29, "depth": 1, "author": "JaiOW2", "replies": [{"selftext": "That was a great analysis.

I was looking at products to help with dry mouth on Amazon and I asked her if the ACT DRY MOUTH GUM could actually help. She said gum in general may help, but she said it\u2019s super important to avoid sugar with dry mouth. She explained that dry mouth is an ideal environment for bacteria to grow in our mouths and adding sugar is feeding the bacteria. She said she\u2019s seen many patients who disclose that they are on ADHD medicine struggle with their teeth being in bad shape and even sometimes rotting, but when she talks to them why it doesn\u2019t seem to ever be about them not brushing their teeth, but more so dry mouth + sugar consuming. I know not everyone is honest with their dental professional, but the point is be careful with your dry mouth if you\u2019re taking medicines that cause it (I was specifally asking her about it in relation to vyvanse). I have used FLINTS MINTS for dry mouth for other reasons before and I reviewed the ingredients in those \u2018mints\u2019 (most are fruit flavored) with her and she said they\u2019re fine because they contain sucralose, not straight sugar. They\u2019ve helped with dry mouth before so I\u2019m hopeful they\u2019ll help tomorrow!\n\nI learned a lot from this conversation with my mom, and as a result of the conversation I\u2019m going to drink more water, avoid sugar as much as possible, brush my teeth more often after consuming sugar, and try flints mints during the day for dry mouth! \n\nLet me know if you have any other dry mouth tips!

I don't necessarily think that ADHD is the only or key problem in your relationship. I say this as I have been in your spouse's position with my ex, however I am the one with ADHD and he did not have a condition. So my advice might sound a little harsher than others, however it might also help you if your spouse indeed has similar perspective as I did. I am also saying this with an idea that your spouse is frustrated with you, and not abusive. If they are emotionally abusive then this does not apply. \n\nFirstly, something that you need to remember is that your spouse has no obligation to tolerate your symptoms. Just as much as you are not obliged to tolerate her negative approach. You might as well explain your condition to her and she might understand it, however that does not take away from how she is affected. Due to your condition, you will be effected by your struggles, but if she is with you, then so will she! If she is using terms like \"it's not an excuse\" or \"it's always about you\", I'm gonna take a wild guess that she wants you to take an initiative and is mainly looking for you to change your approach, not for her to change hers (this is not me saying she is correct to do that, but that you only explain things will not be enough to convince her othervise).\n\nInstead of asking her to change her approchach, give her an actual solution: e.g, You forget to do a chore? You buy dinner, so she doesn't have to worry about that. You have no energy to look after kids? Ask your family/ friends to do that. You have problems with addiction to video games? Get rid of the game completely for a period of time and try to fixiate on something else! You need to redirect your problems instead of asking her to understand. Remember that you are asking her for special treatment, by asking her to live with your condition, so you need to offer her some some special treatment in return. Otherwise, what is she getting out of this relationship? \n\nSeeing some actual results may make her more likely to compromise and accept your flaws. \n\nAnd most importantly, be appreciative of her.

You're just wasting your time/energy this way. Instead, focus on trying to find a coping mechanism for some of your symptoms. One at a time. For example, you struggle with chores? Read a book on how to organise your responsibilities better with ADHD. Dr Russell Barley has great books overall.

Seems to not work. Increase dose.\n\nHypomania is pronounced now (but i didnt realize it. Just thiught vyvanse was like that i guess) at higher Vyvanse dose. Feelings of megalomania, but recognize and test their limits. Pick up new skills quickly, but pressured speech and intensity are scaring people (including myself)\n\nGet off Vyvanse cold turkey, and am tweaky and awake.\n\nSwitch back to adderall (xr this time) and it puts me in a coma at noon when it take it the first day. \n\nSeems to wear off in 5 hours, have an afternoon supplemental.\n\nStill tweaky, we suspect too weak, increased to 30 adderall xr in the am and 30 at night.\n\nQuickly find I can never sleep because the ir wears off and the withdrawal keeps me awake, rather than makes me sleepy.\n\nStress from work (like legal issue level stress) pushes it in to full mania twice this year. 4 days of sleeplessness, complete inability to \"stop\" anything. Scaring the fuck out of everyone with a level of emotional intensity I couldn't control. The slightest movements made me jump like a horror movie. Full tilt mania without delusion.\nI eventually discovered that strong stimulants can in fact stop mania symptoms in their tracks, took a 30 instant at 6 am after being azwake all night, slept like a baby.\n\nWoke up, stopped the drugs, hit peak symptoms including physical stress (my spine is like misaligned now lol) and then slowly returned to normal. I'm 2 months off.\n\n\nThe meds are fantastic. Stress will disrupt your sleep. Sleeplessness will disrupt your medicines efficacy. Which may cause one to ramp m nthe dose up. That's what happened to me. \n\nDoc thinks this is proof of bipolar but I don't agree with this. I think amphetamines can ::4ce mania in healthy people so to put someone on high doses for years isn't proof enough for me of bipolar when they show mania symptoms. They say comorbidity of BD and ADHD is somewhere from 1-50 percent, which says to me they have no clue how it all works. \n\nPersonally, I think this was stress + amphetamines + BPD and not bipolar cuz I've never had those sorts of patterns.

They are not a requirement, and they are not something you can\u2019t change your mind about.\n\nThey aren\u2019t your identity.  They are something you do.\n\nParents have a way of making a big deal out of the cost of supplies for hobbies for their kids, but part of that is a lack of imagination on the parents\u2019 part when it comes to guiding the kids in trying things out.  \n\nAs an adult, I learned how to crochet only after starting medication.\n\nI learned by buying a super saver ball of yarn and the corresponding hook.  It was like a $5 expenditure to find out if it would be something I would really get into.\n\nOnce I had mastered some of the basic stitches to some extent.  I did go a little nuts with wanting to try ALL THE YARNS, but each yarn I tried, I learned something about what I liked or didn\u2019t like.\n\nYou can draw and paint with very cheap supplies.\n\nI used to paint also.  I took watercolor and acrylic classes in elementary school at a local art store.\n\nI bought a very basic oil paint set as an adult after watching a lot of YouTubes on just the basics and what the bare minimum was that was needed.\n\nIt was fun.  I painted a really weird looking still life and messed around with colors for a while.  Then I decided that if I get the urge again, I would need to sign up for a class.  The paint supplies sat in a small box for about three years before I decided I probably wouldn\u2019t be doing the class any time soon, so I tossed the opened paints and donated the brushes and whatnot.\n\nIf I take it up again, I can buy a basic set, but no sense having it hang around to make me have to make that decision over and over again.\n\nIf a crochet project starts to weigh heavy on me, I reflect on whether I really will pick it up again.  Usually the ones that carry guilt are the ones not worth keeping, because I strictly do my hobbies for the joy of doing them, and there\u2019s nothing fun about something that makes me feel guilty.\n\nI think you have to really look inside at why the paintings and paint supplies make you sad.  It\u2019s going to be individual for everyone, but it will likely be some form of shame or guilt.\n\nThen ask yourself why you aren\u2019t painting - because there\u2019s a reason! - and then ask yourself why you don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good enough reason.\n\nWhy did you want to be really good at drawing?  Why was being good at it more important than just enjoying it?\n\nI think a lot of folks with ADHD are surprised to find that most people don\u2019t have that One Thing that they\u2019re good at.  Our lives are long, humans do a lot in that time, and it\u2019s not the only thing they do.\n\nThink about it - every single person you see who acts or performs does other stuff too.\n\nRyan Reynolds is great at acting, but he also sings.\n\nHugh Laurie is a famous actor, but he\u2019s also a musician.\n\nTaylor Swift is a singer, a songwriter, a dancer, a business woman, and she is learning to make her own films.\n\nTrisha Yearwood is an incredible singer, but she also cooks and wrote her own cookbook.\n\nTom Hanks writes fiction and collects typewriters.\n\nBetty White was an animal rights activist.\n\nMayim Bialik is a neuroscientist.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that you\u2019re supposed to do things you enjoy.  The only thing that\u2019s different with ADHD is that when we lose interest, we often just lost it temporarily and may be able to come back to it at a later date.\n\nThe guilt and shame around \u201cquitting\u201d or not \u201cfollowing through\u201d just doesn\u2019t serve us at all - because we didn\u2019t quit, we moved on to something else we liked, just in a more sudden fashion than maybe someone who doesn\u2019t have ADHD.", "ups": 2, "depth": 2, "author": "Savingskitty", "replies": []}]}]}, {"selftext": "This is me.

If you fail your initial drug screen due to stimulants, they aren't going to comb through your application and verify whether you checked the box that you have a disability. All they care about is making sure you have a valid prescription, and this is done through the drug screening employees. If they call you and say that you failed your drug screening, you send them documentation of your prescription, and they tell HR that you passed. The details of what you take and why will not (or should not) be told discussed with your employer. It's a stressful situation, but you aren't doing anything illegal and you shouldn't feel shame taking your meds.\n\nI've selected that I have a disability on applications. It's typically a yes or no option, and they have never asked for more details. I have never mentioned to my boss or during interviews that I have ADHD. I just checked the boxes that I have a disability. No one has ever asked me about it. I have continued to take my meds as prescribed, and I bring my prescription with me to my drug screening, and a couple of times have had to verify after the screening. No one at work was aware of this to my knowledge. Many coworkers did not disclose that they have a disability and the process was the same.\n\nCompanies typically only ask if you have a disability because it looks good on them if they can say they hire people who are disabled. They only ask because it benefits them on paper. That's it. \n\nIf your ADHD doesn't affect your ability to do the job, whether that's because you're medicated or not, it doesn't matter what you disclose on the application. Either option is legal.

Ohio to California, California back to Ohio, and then Ohio to Florida. On my way to California from Ohio, I was in the middle of the desert - with 1/4 tank of gas, and no gas station in sight.

I do feel like I can relate to many other problems people deal with that are posted here, except many of them I also observe in friends without ADHD, so they don't really convince me that I really do have it.\n\nSince my diagnosis, I have been taking 40mg Vyvanse, 15mg Mirtazapine and 75mg Effexor, which I feel like have all improved my level of functioning, however more than anything this improvement comes from a significant increase in mood and motivation, rather than things like attention or hyperactivity.

That can be unique to every adhder. \n\n\nLike for example I want to heat up my coffee; so I put it in the microwave. While I wait I'll start gathering dishes to be washed and other mundane stuff (stacking tasks on top of original task). The microwave goes off, I've heard it, but I'm still doing something else and suddenly I'll forget that I ever heard that microwave and don't actually stop and transition to the new task at hand; ie. going over to get my coffee - my original goal. This occurs so regularly it makes my partner remind me 'the microwave went off' - not once but several times a day since it will keep beeping.\n\n \nOn the flip side at work for example, I get a task to fix a dashboard. I can quickly find the problem and the steps to rectify it. I know what measures to use and the formulas applicable. I know how the data connects. I can still have trouble remembering what I just named something and will end up putting in the maximum effort to compensate my short term memory. The outcome on the outside is that people may think im a high performer just because the task isn't something everyone does/knows about. But the problem is for my level of skill the actual effort I use to produce things is much higher than appropriate/expected - and thats just for the *basic* things. \n\n\nI feel like the emotional dysregulation, motivation deficit, and fixating on thoughts are kind of just secondary outcomes to the disorganisation, distractibility and forgetfulness. There's always bits of it in every single thing I do. And all the small consequences really stack up. \n\n\nImagine leaving the house for work each day and the order in which you do your morning routine somehow is always different. It could be that last night you placed your keys and lanyard somewhere you thought made sense but in the morning you've forgotten. Or you accidentally skip a step and forget to brush your teeth or brush your hair. So you're late again. Then in the afternoon, maybe you're finishing up work but you keep thinking of something to add to your report that would be a good idea, or it just isn't 'right' *yet*. You finish a sentence and without a pause start another one. Suddenly its 6pm and you are exhausted - it is way later than the original goal. All the other things you need to do for yourself or other people keeps getting pushed back. You suddenly have new priorities and even less time to do it and something always takes priority constantly. It can be so overwhelming. \n\n\nI've always felt adhd was like stubbing your toe on uneven foot path. Every step you take makes you trip a little bit. But then sometimes the path is clear and you just run. But you don't usually run and it feels really good to keep going. So you keep running and don't actually have the ability to slow down and stop. \n\nIf you feel your level of functioning in life is better with medication then it would be in your best interest to continue and feel confident about your diagnosis. \n\nMeds just like the experience of adhd is very unique to everyone. If your targeted symptoms; attention and hyperactivity aren't being addressed then you should speak to your doctor. It may be the case of needing a higher dose or it being paired with short acting formula or a change in timing to capture your window of best focus. \n\nFor hyperactivity for example, I used the benchmark of me standing up and leaving my desk. Prior to medication I would need to run off for a quick walk around the building every 15-20minutes or getting my next coffee. But once Medicated its gotten better and I can choose to go for a walk every hour or so like a normal person.

We are shaped by both hard-wiring and our environment/experience, and each sphere influences the other. For example, say you\u2019re not genetically predisposed to depression, but trauma or other circumstances result, and depression is the consequence. Now the neurons fire such that you\u2019re now physiologically predisposed to depression, even if it\u2019s only situational depression, and even if it resolves for the time being.

It all comes down to education.", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "hazyberto", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Many reasons that I can summarize as \u201cIgnorance\u201d\n- an assumption that adhd treatment is new and that we don\u2019t know the long term effects of children being medicated for adhd. The first amphetamine stimulant was approved by the FDA in 1936 (the brand Benzedrine doesn\u2019t exist today), then what we now know as Ritalin was FDA approved in 1944. Children were treated with these then. \n- an assumption that any use of amphetamines or methamphetamine is going to lead to addiction. WWII saw the first widespread non medical use of these drugs, as soldiers were dosed for nighttime operations (to keep them alert and awake). As far as I have been able to find, the US military didn\u2019t see overdoses or widespread addiction or psychosis issues from this use of stimulants (should be noted that other allies and axis nations used them too). What this tells me is that under sane, controlled usage, these drugs can have non medical benefits that don\u2019t end up in widespread abuse. The 60s brought along amateur lab production (some amphetamine, but meth was easier to make), with people being sold and taking higher doses - that did bring along larger issues. Then the war on drugs cemented the stigma in the 70s. \n- an assumption that amphetamines and methamphetamine are the same. They have similarities. One of these does not target most ADHD symptoms as well as the other, hence why almost no adhd meds contain methamphetamine (Desoxyn does - I don\u2019t know anyone on it). So not only are the medical grade version of these drugs different, but add to that the fact that street drugs don\u2019t follow fda approved processes and that dealers want to addict you and only addict you with no process to stop use of the drugs if they harm the public\u2026 street meth is not medicine and it will never be. Could be laced or contaminated with literally anything.\n- an assumption that adhd is a modern thing or caused by tech or parenting. This is debunked by modern studies and get this. Some believe that Peter (the apostle) exhibited adhd traits (not looking to talk religion, thanks, but contemporaries writing about his behavior noted significant traits, 2000 years ago). Hippocrates mentioned (almost in passing) a disorder and \u201ctreatment\u201d plan that overlaps with adhd significantly (500BC). Or read Tom Sawyer and tell me the character didn\u2019t have adhd in the 1800s. \n\nI think the decentralized research approach and constant name changes hurt societal adhd awareness significantly. Adhd has had over a dozen names in the last 200 years, 4 main names in the past 50, and we know people want to change the name again. How then would a regular person with no interest in adhd know that we\u2019ve had approved meds that treat it since 1936. Or that adhd and add are the same thing. Or so many other things.\n\nADHD has a MAJOR issue when it comes to \u201cbranding\u201d and awareness. Before the name changes next, we would be well served by demanding tech platforms introduce a \u201cmodern name of this condition\u201d feature into tools like Google scholar. That would give researchers and laypeople who use these tools an easy button to see \u201coh, hyperkinetic child, what\u2019s that. It\u2019s adhd? Ahh. I see.\u201d It would also help any other conditions where people have outdated notions or don\u2019t understand \u201cwhy did the research into psychopathy end\u201d (it did not, it\u2019s just not named that anymore).", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "Free_Dimension1459", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Pain management of people who really need it has had the same sort of stigma, because of the opioid epidemic.

I can't be on the lookout or listenout, or whatever, for messages. It's not my life's mission to reply ASAP, nor even to provide immediate acknowledgement of receipt with an ETA on a full reply.

Thought patterns and belief systems come from somewhere, they don't just spontaneously appear. The socially anxious person trying to anticipate what everyone is going to say might be there because they had an inconsistent parent who never explained the rules and would get angry at things they didn't make clear. They aren't socially anxious because they are irrational, the beginnings are very rational.\n\nHowever the results of social anxiety *can* (but not always) be irrational. So trying to read everyone's minds, or presupposing everyone is doubting you or thinking negatively about you is exaggerated, that's what makes it a cognitive distortion, a real, unpleasant trauma taught you to think in a way which isn't functionally healthy or representative of the wider reality other than the situation which brought it about.\n\nThis I think is why third wave therapies like DBT came through, they are just so much better for painting a full picture, because it takes a very good therapist in traditional CBT to untangle the difference between cognitive distortions being exaggerated and the actual disorder itself being rational or irrational. It often gets conflated, and a lot of people with depression for instance tend to conflate the two in regards to themselves as a common symptom in depression is splitting (black and white thinking). They tend to think the idea that one can have an irrational thought that stems from depression means depression is irrational, which isn't true, they tend to also conflate that founded in reality = rational, which in fact it can be either.\n\nIt gets even more complicated when you have conditions like ADHD or ASD in the mix. As you then get something like depression or anxiety which stems from you anticipating your own problems you know are there. When therapists play off depression or anxiety as irrational here it can be very dehumanizing, and I think the sign of a bad therapist as they should be first looking at where the disorder emerges from, as it almost always comes from a very real place, and that's also why sometimes depression or anxiety can't be effectively treated (treatment resistant), because the same environment or conditions are still there.", "ups": 3, "depth": 3, "author": "JaiOW2", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Sometimes it\u2019s not about whether something is true but how much I think it matters.

It also took me 4 therapists to be the right person to make the process and do the work I needed to do. The first three spread out at different points in my life in my late teens and 20s all helped, all were good, I liked working with all of them. Most of them were happy to help me duct tape my life back together and send me on my way. \n\nMy last and present therapist is the one that taught me to cope and to manage. She taught me techniques to help me understand how I needed to work in the world. When I felt like I was \"finished\" with therapy, I kept going. I was ready to make permanent changes in my life and not just patch things back together so I could manage. \n\nSecond, I was dealing with trauma(s) as well as ADHD. So my story might be different here. I had real deep hard to deal with trauma that certainly was a part of who I was as much as my ADHD. \n\nMedication helped me do therapy until I was ready to navigate the world on my own. I know some people need medication all the time and some people shun it. My take at the time was \"I'm struggling and its effecting everything in my life. I need that to stop\" so I took medication for years while I did therapy and learned how to manage things in my life. Then when I was ready I went off medication. I have a deal with my therapist that if I get overwhelmed or start to spiral I need to be clear about it and go back on meds if I think I need them. I've done that a few times (finishing my Master's thesis for example) but I like to manage things as much as I can now with the understanding that my brain is a little different and I need to make sure I am working jobs and in situations that play to my strengths and when I'm in places that challenge me I need to be honest about whats going on. \n\nTo me therapy has been something that has not only saved my life but allowed me to thrive.

I\u2019ve made a lot of progress on my latest burnout phase, so I\u2019ll list the things that helped me, in order of importance!\n\n1) Sleep. I know it\u2019s hard for a lot of us, but this is key. 8 hours of sleep, at the same time, day after day. Mood and circadian rhythm are significantly correlated. Try melatonin, or talking to your doctor for personalized sleep recommendations.\n\n2) Water &amp; Food. I COMPLETELY redid my entire nutrition routine from the ground up, and it was lifesaving. It makes sense really, energy is needed for motivation, and energy can only really come from food. Water is of course necessary to transport energy throughout your body effectively, and it does so best through consistent drinking, rather than sporadic gulps (took me forever to learn this). As far as diet is concerned, personalize as much as you\u2019d like, but I prefer a high protein diet as it keeps my metabolism going &amp; the energy flowing.\n\n3) Routine. It\u2019s important to understand that habits are morally neutral. They are not inherently bad, nor good. They just are. Humans are habit forming creatures. Good habits however, are vital. Us with ADHD struggle with routine, but I find that I can form habits the same as anyone else, with maybe more effort ;-)\n\n4) Medication? Medication is a helpful routine setter in my opinion for those of us with ADHD. It does temporarily tell the brain to increase dopamine production, and therefore motivation will probably increase. It\u2019s important to understand that medication will be SUBSTANTIALLY less effective with poor underlying nutrition, as the underlying amino acids for dopamine just won\u2019t be there.\n\n5) Self care. Be gentle with yourself. I know I find it hard to let things go sometimes. I find it hard to write a bad day off as just a bad day. Things like that.

First, stimulants also act on norepinephrine which is just as important in ADHD, and a significant portion of how stimulants work is reuptake inhibition, which means it isn't actually increasing the production of monoamines, it's reducing the rate your synapse vacuums up the neurotransmitters resulting in increased concentrations. Technically your body is not producing more, just the current levels are higher. \n\nSecond to follow this line of reasoning you'd expect poor nutrition that focuses on the production of these monoamines to result in things like parkinsonisms (a disorder defined by low dopamine in specific areas), which isn't quite true either. \n\nThird the gut microbiome could be fairly important to these conversations. Fiber as a nutrient for gut microbiota which in turn produce neurotransmitters and signal to the brain, a significant portion of the dopamine and serotonin in our bodies is produced in the gut. \n\nFourth the body makes dopamine and norepinephrine from enzymatic conversion of tyrosine, which the body makes from phenylalanine, which is an amino acid pretty much nobody is low in unless they have a specific genetic disorder ( phenylketonuria). Your body is more resourceful than you think too, it can keep the levels of these transmitters up for a very long time by recycling your own body. \n\nNot denying that nutrition is important here, but I don't think the importance of nutrition in a condition like ADHD is getting enough amino acids to make dopamine. It's probably a bit more complicated than that, hell, studies on people who are starving find that their levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are usually elevated for quite some time, as it encourages food seeking behavior.

I had to call out of work multiple days last week because I got up way too late to even call out and come in late.

I haven't always been on Prozac (just since 2020) and even before she added it I was still sleepy every morning. So I stopped the Prozac, and on top of that, she added this new medication, Jornay.\n\nThe way it works is that you take it at night about 8 hours before you need to wake up. And you wake up fully alert and feeling rested the next morning! I tried it and it works for me! I've been getting up at 8 am the past few days, even before my alarm goes off.\n\nNot gonna say this is a wonder drug for everyone and everyone's brain chemistry is different (this is NOT medical advice), also it's very new and I'm lucky my insurance covers it, however I've found it to be way better than Vyvanse at keeping me alert and focused during the day.\n\nJust so excited because now I won't lose my job and wanted to share!", "ups": 17, "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/16qin50/jornay_saved_my_job/", "num_comments": 14}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Your body is unique, as are your needs.

Even tho I have absolutely no intention of making things harder for my coworkers and managers, once I keep making a few small but significant mistakes a certain number of times, I notice their attitude towards me goes from being nice and friendly to cold and snappy. Like they\u2019re already fed up with me and want to maintain distance. I can imagine what goes on inside their heads. They think I\u2019m not trying hard enough and make me out to be somebody that expects things to be done for them which isn\u2019t true at all. If anything, I try harder than anybody else can bother to imagine. \n\nWhen I quit or get fired, there was always an excuse that bad management or lack of accountability is what made me change jobs frequently, that it\u2019s not just my ADHD that\u2019s the problem at how things went down at work. But then the most painful thing I am faced with nowadays is having a job full of workers that actually care abt me as part of the team. But once I start making mistakes due to lack of attention and overthinking, the same thing happens. And when that moment occurs, I end up staying in my car in front of my house and break down crying from the exhaustion of having to live with this terrible curse that is ADHD. Working harder to make up for my mistakes is easier said than done. \n\nI think the only good news I have to tell is that I\u2019m finally getting tested for ADHD on Monday and am planning on taking my results to my PCP so I can finally be put on medication.

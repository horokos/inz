I tried to write these fantasy novels that fantasy buffs sounded excited about, but it never came naturally. It felt like most of the process was a huge grind, always going back to the drawing board. Then, I decided to try write a romance one-shot for my husband, which turned into a short story, then a novella, and now a three-part novel.

But for some reason I decided to participate in it, and managed to actually complete it.\n\nThe two things I learned that year was 1) I can produced finished art if given no time to do it, and 2) I could still do art.  They were important answers for me because I'd given up thinking I'd ever get back to art.\n\nSince then I've participated in it every year but one. Every time I participated I fully completed it, and I tried to add a challenge to it. (One year, I put background in as much as possible as background scared me, another year I made sure all my images related to a singular main theme as well as secondary daily prompts).  I am always so happy to have these images to scroll back through, and always amazed at how much art I produced.\n\nLast year I wasn't sure I was going to do it, and finally decided last minute to participate, but decided to do it all in woodburning - something I'd just picked up and was enjoying and by no means had much experience with.  I figured making myself do it every day would help me improve and it did.\n\nBut your post resonated with me because I agree, it's exhausting.  For as much art and progress I feel like I make every year when I do it, I move 2 steps back after it's finished, creatively exhausted, and unfortunately uninspired to produce more art with out a rigid deadline over my head.  And honestly while it got me over some of my other fear hurdles, part of the fun of Inktober is that \"This is the best I could do in a day\" makes up for a lot of sins and takes a lot of pressure off producing a finished piece.\n\nBut now I realize my fear of producing a final product that isn't perfect cripples me the rest of the year, since I no longer have the excuse \"Oh but I had to do that in a day, so it's okay it's not right.\"\n\nSo between the cop-out and the creative exhaustion, I decided this year I need to not participate. Being October 1, I am still worried I'll cave and churn something out, or my FOMO will kick in hard.  But instead I've decided I've used the past years Inktober to grow and learn something about myself, and this year I need to learn how to incorporate art back into my life as a regular part and not a creative sprint that leaves me in recovery the next 11 months.\n\nThe first two years I even managed to do Inktober, then NaNoWriMo November - how I have no idea, and sadly my increased pressure on myself to do Inktober basically stifled my ability to do anything even writing related after.\n\nI think \\*not\\* doing inktober is as important a decision as trying to do it, and I'm glad to see you're putting yourself first in this case.

Sometimes people just like the attention they get online for doing it. People have a motivator, a reason to do art.\n\nFor me, I don't particularly care about the attention I may or may not get online, I don't care about fitting into a community, I don't have a story to tell, I don't want to or need to share my emotions or any of that. I also don't think I'd really ever be able to do art as a job, given how I operate on spontaneity rather than being super consistent.\n\nSo I'm struggling to find a motivator. I don't really have fun doing art either, it's more a meditative / relaxing thing for me, and I enjoy it for the challenge, but other things are often more appealing / worthwhile to me -- as a result I do art like once a month if I'm lucky. But I want to do it more, I just need a way to justify it to my brain.\n\nTo that end, what motivates you to do art?

Some of them are obvious and intuitive, crying can take me from sad to calm, learning can take me from curious to satisfied. Some are a lot trickier, a good meal will move me from lonely to bored, the right songs can take me from anxious to nostalgic.\n\nBut fractal art is different. It doesn't matter what emotional state I'm in, from inspired and creative to self-loathing and depressed, if I go through the process to make some fractal art, I will end up excited about it and wanting to share it. Over time, I learned to recognize that \"I want to share this\" was a shade of \"I'm proud of myself\". So now, even if I don't share the art I made, I can still appreciate that feeling. Because I've done the process enough times, it's not any harder to start than it is to make a sandwich, so I really can get into it from almost any emotional state, even apathetic ones.\n\nI'm fortunate that showing off my art has opened up doors and given me other things to be proud about, I'm even beginning to feel a bit of general confidence in myself.

One of the benefits for taking a course is that you get guaranteed feedback. If you're that hungry for critiques, and it's not a single idea you're struggling with, then consider going through an online course. Obviously, in person would be better, but I don't know what offerings you have in your immediate area.\n\nI do know that Watts Atelier offers an [online](https://www.wattsatelier.com/#online) course that's designed for beginners so they're sure you have a strong grasp of the fundamentals. You take the courses on your schedule and they have a grading team available for you to ask questions and get feedback from. You can start with their $99 a month core foundations in pencil and graphite, which will allow you to submit your work to their grading team for regular, incremental feedback.\n\nIf you want instructor level feedback, then they charge $499 a month and you can get a critique per week from an instructor and 2, 30 minute coaching sessions per month from an instructor.\n\nAnother place I know of is [Comic Pro Boot Camp](https://www.comicprobootcamp.com/service-page/1-1-online-session-bonus-follow-up?referral=service_list_widget), which offers 1-on-1 mentoring at a rate of $250 per 90 minute session with a 20 minute follow-up. That one's geared more towards comic professionals, but the artists are all 20-30 year industry vets who have their fundamentals sorted.\n\nI know that the folks over at [CreatureArtTeacher](https://creatureartteacher.com/) have floated the idea of creating a member's only discord, as well as they talked about taking portfolios for review by Aaron and the team. Their community has been asking him for portfolio reviews for quite a while, so it's something they're trying to implement at some point. Keep an eye out there, if you're interested. The site's got a lot of content for animal drawing and animation, but some of the best fundamentals courses I've taken were at that website.\n\nRight now, Proko's running a [Drawing Basics](https://www.proko.com/course/drawing-basics/overview) course that, last time I checked, has not been completed. The way he does these courses is that he'll post lesson content for students to go through, then wait for submissions, then review some of them on video and upload the content as assignment critique. You likely won't get your specific content reviewed by him, since he's been getting swamped with submissions for his basics course, but the assignment critiques tend to cover common issues students struggle with for that assignment.\n\nThe other great thing about Proko is that he has staff who come through the comments sections and provide feedback. I don't know how frequently they do it, but every lesson acts as it's own forum specifically for that video. I'll come through a 50 part course and see activity from months past that has engagement and feedback on lesson 35 or whatever. You have to pay for the courses to unlock the discussions, so it's less usable than general feedback or a portfolio review, but it's another way of getting feedback.\n\nI've read good and bad things about the Watts-Atelier online courses, namely that the video courses can have less focused lectures where the instructor talks about whatever comes to mind while they work. Personally, I've not found that to be distracting when I'm watching someone draw, but I can understand how it would be frustrating.\n\nThe other thing I've read is that it can take weeks or months to get feedback on an assignment. The good news, is that if it's taking you that long to get feedback, then you know you're getting actual feedback. I believe they limit how many assignments you can submit per lesson, but I don't think they limit you on how quickly you go through the lessons. If all you want is the feedback, then presumably you could buy the monthly rate, blitz through as many lessons as you had energy for, submit a bunch of assignments for them, and get feedback.\n\nI know you asked for communities you could join, not premium critique options, but what you're looking for really doesn't sound like something a community is going to freely offer. Even if you settled on accepting feedback from a layperson who doesn't have a ton of industry experience, the act of picking apart someone's art to understand what they did, what they were trying to do, and what resources / techniques they need to be leveraging to fix it can often feel like investigating a crime scene.\n\nIf you're getting reliable, consistent, pointed feedback that's specific to your artwork, then someone's investing a lot of time into your growth as an artist. That's why you find communities who will take a 5 second look at your post, say something basic like \"the hand's off, here's a bunch of stuff on hands,\" and move on is because connecting the dots to effectively markup and redraw your work for you is much higher effort than just pointing out what their eye sees in the moment.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've personally found the most benefit from finding the correct resources to learn from. Chances are, you're confused about your basics because you haven't had the right information put in front of you and so you feel ill-equipped to self-critique.\n\nYour eye is supposed to leap frog ahead of your hand when it comes to art growth, which means you're supposed to gain the knowledge of how to do something correctly so you calibrate your eye to recognize the failures in your artwork before you practice correcting them. If you're at a point where you don't like the quality, but you don't know *why* you don't like the quality, then consider reading / researching more to train your eye to understand the mistakes of your hands.\n\nI don't think you can effectively maintain your art education by drawing a bunch of stuff and having people tell you what's wrong with it. That sounds like you're learning by only training half of your tools--it sounds like you're neglecting your eye training. Either you were getting recommended terrible videos, or you were given good videos and you want someone who's trained to understand what the videos are explaining to give you the ELI5 short hand on a drawing by drawing basis until you've made enough mistakes, and gotten enough feedback on those mistakes, that one day you've covered all the fundamentals.\n\nThat sounds like learning in reverse, like you want to skip making the books and videos make sense and just have someone tell you how to draw every time you try to draw.", "ups": 3, "depth": 0, "author": "NoSleep0nlyDraw", "replies": [{"selftext": "Thanks for pointing out the the paid courses. Thats what I plan on asking about next if I'm not able to find a community. I'm willing to pay any amount of money to get help learning the basics of drawing. It seems I will need far more than most people if I am ever to make any progress.\n\nWatts looks to be the most appealing. Comicbookprofessionals is too scant on information for me to tell much about it. Proko is one I want to stay away from based on the years I tried to learn anything from his free courses.\n\nThe problem is I don't understand how to progress. I have tried all the local classes (both inside and outside of college) and they don't seem to be serious. I passed all of them but, l found that I had learned nothing from them. Asking the instructors for help was a waste of time since they refused to tell me (or anyone else) what was wrong with their work. Frequently most of these people had no idea how to draw anything realistically and had no desire to. \n\nI have no idea how to glean any information from the books. I've been trying to learn for more time than most people are willing to believe. When I first began I tried going through \"(The New) Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" I have never been more confused in my life. The exercises inside were confusing and I was ever able to find a use for what I was suppose to learn in that book. I finished it without learning anything at all. The Keys to Drawing was barely any better. The self evaluation was incredibly bad for trying to learn anything and i eventually ended up giving that book up fairly on. I retried it 3 times but, never made it very far. \"How to Draw\" by Robertson became confusing and ultimately too difficult to continue on with. I ended up failing at the spiral staircase and never understanding how to do it properly. I completed Andrew Loomis's \"Fun With a Pencil\" but, still felt like i learned nothing at all. recreating his cartoon characters using shapes wasn't useful. I can't seem to apply this information anywhere else.", "ups": 2, "depth": 1, "author": "Magnetic_Scrolls", "replies": [{"selftext": "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is a mixed bag. It has techniques that work to make you look at your drawing in different ways, like flipping the page, drawing with a grid, that kind of thing. Those are actually useful techniques so you think about the shapes of objects, not your idea of the objects.\n\nUnfortunately, that book was based heavily on flawed conclusions from research regarding split brained patients. We now understand that the interactions of our brain are extremely [interconnected](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/right-brainleft-brain-right-2017082512222) across the halves, and it's unlikely that there is a \"sidedness\" to brain activity, such that you need to learn how to suppress one side and bring out the other side to think.\n\nThe point is, techniques that get you to think about drawing shapes are useful, alllll of the mythos around suppressing one side of your brain to engage the right side of your brain just doesn't have any scientific backing. We've [scanned brains](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071275) of a bunch of people doing various activities and couldn't find evidence of \"sidedness\".\n\nThat being said, the takeaway from that book is to draw according to shapes and lines by paying attention to the relationships between those shapes and lines. When you start out drawing, you tend to be very linear with little nuance to gesture and little nuance given to designing your lines. Stop thinking in terms of the complete, complex contour and break things down into shapes that can be expressed through [C, S, and I lines](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pWzDBuzoE-Q).\n\nPay attention to angle changes. Go back to How to Draw by Scott Robertson and flip to the line exercises area. In there, you'll see an exercise explained for you to drop points on the page before \"carving through\" the points to create a seamless line. It's on page 17, I think.\n\nDo that exercise a LOT, but don't hatch your line. Don't chicken scratch it. Make every line between the points a smooth, crisp, clear C or I line. You're either drawing a straight between the points or you're drawing a curve. If you want to construct an S line, then draw 5 points corresponding to the 2 end points, the center point, and the 2 curve apexes. Now build that S out of successive C curves with varying degrees of curvature to them.\n\nNow every time you draw a contour line, you draw with those C, S, and I lines. You think about lines in C, S, I. These are your new letters, and you're going to make a whole lot of cool shape words with them.\n\nI would also recommend you do the exercises in chapters 3, 5, and 6. Skip 4, it's a chapter to show you how to build grids. You don't need grids for XYZ drawing, which is how you think in three dimensional forms. Skip everything else in the book for now, you don't need it. Drawing landscapes, building houses, drawing spiral staircases, none of that will get you introduced into thinking three dimensionally. Circle back to the other concepts once you've figured out how to divide a plane and transfer it onto another axis.\n\nThe exercises in those chapters are *extremely* explicit. It's literally \"draw this line\" and it shows you the line. \"Add this other line from this point\" and it shows you what line it's talking about in red with a pixel perfect picture from a computer next to Robertson's own hand sketch.\n\nEllipses in perspective can be tricky, but the only thing you *really* need to know is that you have to make the major and minor axis perpendicular to one another. Don't sweat a badly drawn ellipse. If you really care about getting precise ellipses, then use [guides](https://www.amazon.com/Alvin-TD333-Small-Ellipse-Template/dp/B000KNPX4U). I don't use guides, Scott Robertson doesn't use guides, because no one uses guides--not when they're sketching. You only use those guides when you need something to be cleaned up and pretty looking.\n\nIf you want more practice with ellipses, then draw them inside of [10 square grids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYdcOJBcFeY) in perspective and you'll see how the proportions change. You can also think of them as 4 C curves inside of a crossed out plane, like [this](https://youtu.be/zPDbca83V5Y?feature=shared&amp;t=20). Once you get comfortable plotting the major and minor axis, then the rest is a matter of drawing the C curve quadrants.\n\nYou can skip over all the ellipse subdivision in chapter 5. Bother with that if you come back through chapter 4 for the perspective grid stuff.\n\nReally, what you need to get out of Robertson's How to Draw is encapsulated by fig. 6.81 at the bottom of page 99. That's drafting. That's thinking in three dimensions. That's XYZ drawing. The rest of that book is application of those drafting principles, the actual techniques that get you thinking in three dimensions are only a couple of chapters worth. Everything else is perspective theory expanded into grids and applied across different types of vehicles.\n\nI had the same issue you did with How to Draw, where it was just too confusing to march through it page by page. Once I realized the XYZ techniques Robertson's using in his day to day drawing are a pretty small, and pretty straight forward part of the book I zero'ed in on those. Everything else made more sense.\n\nFun with a Pencil is a good way to get someone drawing who's never drawn before, but it's not going to teach you deeper level fundamentals. Think of that book as more of a primer so you start putting marks on your page.\n\nBased on those three books you told me, I can understand why you struggled so badly. You had the wrong resources. None of what makes the Right Side of the Brain book work is because of anything to do with the theory it was founded on, Robertson's How to Draw is so absurdly dense that unless you already know what's in it you're going to think it's too complicated to work through, and Loomis' Fun with a Pencil is literally just getting you to draw cartoon heads so drawing doesn't seem so scary.\n\nBased on everything you've told me, here's what I'd recommend--because it's what worked for me--pick up the [Dynamic Bible](https://superanius.com/products/peter-han). That book will walk you through building primitives in three dimensions, adding contours, drawing them merged together, it has sections on ellipses, it has examples for you to draw arrow forms rising up off of planes, etc. That book *will not* teach you how to work completely in all three of the XYZ axes, but it *will* teach you how to draw enough primitives to be able to learn your parallels and your perpendiculars. It'll get you thinking and drawing in forms.\n\nBoxes can be a struggle, and I think [this video will help](https://youtu.be/rkp1xfWJ9n4?feature=shared), but you gotta get confident drawing them in different degrees of rotation. Think about what lines are converging where and think about them in terms of their *axis*.\n\nOnce you feel comfortable with the Dynamic Bible, then move back to Robertson's How to Draw and work through Chapters 3, 5, and 6. Don't worry about understanding *all* the stuff in that book all at once. Just worry about putting one line down at a time, following Robertson's examples *exactly* and then do some XYZ drawing on your own.\n\nWhat I found, was that I started thinking in terms of the axis lines and I started problem solving my way to points on my page other than how Robertson was describing them. Something clicked and I started seeing pathways to solving those puzzles. That's when XYZ drawing made sense to me and when three dimensional forms made sense.\n\nIf you get stuck, then look through Dan Beardshaw's [perspective playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-KzNu9Twg0&amp;list=PL7xvYrkzD7N9UUEn_o15wrXZ1Z6lM9t0S). Beardshaw started drawing realism by using the grid method and he got phenomenally good at it, freakishly good--so good in fact that he got bored. But when he started drawing things from imagination, he realized he had no idea how to work with the fundamentals. So that playlist on perspective is Beardshaw cataloging his journey learning perspective from square 1. You can do the exercises he shows on video along with him, he has *excellent* explanations for why he's doing what he's doing, and his line quality is second to none.

No one just like invents something brand new from scratch. Everything is just remixing other things. And I mean *everything*. Like, when you see something totally weird and out there and you think \"wow that's so creative how did they come up with that???\" it's because you don't get the reference(s). You may not be able to identify all of the pieces of other stuff that already existed that came together to make the thing you're looking at, but that doesn't mean the thing isn't made of a bunch of pieces of other stuff.\n\nSo what does that mean for you? Well it means you have to go collect more things that already exist. You have to read more things that interest you, look at more art that interests you, meet new people, have new experiences, download more stuff into your brain. And it means you just have to make stuff, experiment, play, accept that most of the stuff you make won't be very good but that's not what making stuff is for anyway. Like, you say you wanted to design a new plant, but you actually want to design a new plant that *looks good*. And like, that's a reasonable feeling for sure. But if you want to design a new plant you're going to have to design a bunch of ones that look dumb and terrible first. Them's the rules. If \"new plant\" is too broad a task and you don't know where to start, write a bunch of words down and pull them out of a hat, or turn to a random page in the book nearest to you and point at 3 random words and then use those as a prompt for this new plant you're designing. It's okay if it looks dumb. Draw another one. It's okay if it looks like a plant that already exists. Draw another one. What qualities should this plant have? Like, is it a happy plant or a sad plant or a poisonous plant or a spiky dangerous but very valuable plant that the creatures of this world need to risk their safety to harvest for some kind of life or death reason? What would a cure-for-cancer plant look like? What would the world's sweetest smelling flower look like? What would the most deadly plant look like? What other kinds of plants are there and what other kinds of stories are there that sound interesting *to you*? Okay now pull up 3 pictures of 3 totally different weird looking plants from totally different environments. What would it look like if you combined them into one plant? How do you make it still make sense as a plant? What cool new combo powers does a plant with cactus spines *and* stinky corpse flowers *and* long climbing vines have? What cool purposes do each of those things serve now, in the real world, to the real plants that have them?\n\nYou see where I'm going with this? Learn cool new stuff!

The basic premise of drawing is to *stylize real life*. So - if you try to learn to draw off a specific style like manga, you're attempting skip ahead and jump right to the stylization without actually *understanding* the underlying anatomy - basically you don't understand *why* they're drawing things like they are. You're just blindly copying. And that's a very bad way to go about learning how to draw.\n\nI'd recommend some anatomy books, if you can get ahold of them.  I'm 41, so my resources might be out of date. But these have served me well, from art school to today: *Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing from Life*, and *Anatomy for the Artist* by Jeno Barcsay. I'm sure others could have good suggestions for reference as well.\n\nIf you want to get better, you need to *practice with specific intent to learn;* **don't** just doodle aimlessly. So, that means anatomy exercises. Learn the [anatomical markers for faces](https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/human-anatomy-fundamentals-basics-of-the-face--cms-20417) and other parts of the body, and practice using them to construct your forms. [This](https://www.artistsnetwork.com/art-mediums/drawing-human-head/) also looks like a good page for facial anatomical proportions and markers. [The whole thumb thing is a meme](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-artists-hold-up-their-thumbs-when-painting), but it's an extremely useful tool to measure out proportions. Compare the width of the head to the height of the head in a portrait study. compare the width of the nose to the width of the eye. Measure out your angles. Etc.\n\nTry out things like the Loomis method for constructing faces. There are other methods as well, experiment and figure out which works best for you.\n\nA good exercise that my teacher also had us do was to copy [classical images of nude figures](https://usaartnews.com/news/male-nudes-in-art-history), and then use tracing paper to use the anatomical landmarks to draw the underlying skeleton. I took a [quick set of pictures](https://imgur.com/a/TV8UWLj) from my old homework for you to show you how it should look finished. *I can't believe I still have these.*\n\nThis is a more vague tip, but one that's helped me immensely overall - I try to visualise any image that I see or want to draw as a low poly 3D object, like in Blender. I try to imagine the planes of the surface and how they interact with each other and look in perspective. I frequently construct my anatomy as flat planes like this in my sketch, then round things out to a more natural look in my final linework.\n\nEdit: Another note. Squaring off your anatomy, and using straight lines in general, off frequently helps *immensely.* eg: fingers are not round sausages, they're actually squared off in shape. Fingers in real life do not taper to points (like in your posted hand practice), only the very bottom front of the finger tip is rounded. You need to really *look and see what's actually there* what's there when you're working on your anatomy. For me, at least, it's a very intense process. You *cannot* just wing it.\n\nThese videos are older than me, but are positively legendary. Robert Beverly Hale was an anatomy master and thankfully we got some recordings of his lectures. Hopefully these might help you.\n\n[Playlist - Artistic Anatomy Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_Yf0hghQSFJSvaPd5T3twgq8G2X6L-j8)", "ups": 21, "depth": 0, "author": "squishybloo", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "How have you tried to improve?", "ups": 34, "depth": 0, "author": "yetanotherpenguin", "replies": [{"selftext": "I've tried learning anatomy as everyone tells me to, but I can never get it right, I'll have entire sketchbooks filled with trying to figure how to draw hands, faces, poses, but nothing seems to stick", "ups": 4, "depth": 1, "author": "Lesouth03", "replies": [{"selftext": "Maybe go back one steps and focus on drawing shapes and volumes for a while. \n\nTake a look at the drawing database on YT and start from the top.", "ups": 46, "depth": 2, "author": "yetanotherpenguin", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "You're not improving because you're practicing the wrong way.

There's also the fact you probably have improved loads just by observing the world and simply drawing.\n\nPeople will split hairs and tell you all these fancy rules about learning the right way blah blah blah, but honestly? If you can learn to love the process of drawing, no matter the outcome, it doesn't matter about improving or styles - your natural curosity to learn and observe the world (on top of just general daily practice) will get you there. Being good at art is just learning to be passionate about problem solving, the process of creating, and to work hard for it. Simple as. If you can do that, learning the fundimentals will be less like taking your medicine, and can actually be enjoyable. The only formal art training I ever did was a class on botanical illustration, I basically taught myself through the internet, books, and just utilising what I learnt. You will have this issue crop up many times as an artist, but just keep pushing, keep reenforcing those fundimentals, and learn to just enjoy the process &lt;3\n\n(Also ignore people saying not to copy, they should clarify it's better to observe a piece of art and reverse engineer it by breaking down the fundimentals used to create it, look up how to do master's studies.

In the creating of it you are engaging with art and by extension the very act of creating an object you will be calling art speaks to the meaning of that creation determining the objects status. The argument I could see negating the idea is what I will call the doodle idea, it is that if the start of the act of creating doesn't have the prior engagement with the goal or meaning of the piece, example being a meaningless doodle the intention wasn't set forth to accomplish this goal and so the object of the event isn't art because the meaning of the doodle doesn't align with its truth.

From the start, she was very professional, almost too professional. When I would compliment her work, she would never say thank you and would disregard it and move on. I found this off putting, but she was the cheapest artist I could afford and her art was pretty good. I sent her a reference photo and she didn\u2019t get the pose right at all, and after some back and forth communication, she said she\u2019ll just redo it.\n\nThis made me feel bad even it wasn\u2019t my fault and I told her how sorry I felt but she ignored me. When she finally got the sketch right, she said I had to pay upfront before she\u2019ll continue and I did. She also said she\u2019ll send me her process. After I payed, I sent her a photo as proof that I sent her the money and she left me on read for a while. I had to text her again to confirm that she received payment and how the art was going before she just said that she received the money but didn\u2019t say anything about the art and never updated me like she said. I had also asked her to fix a few things on the sketch and she said she would.\n\nAfter about a week, she just sent me the final thing and the stuff I asked to be fixed wasn\u2019t fixed. This was irritating because had she sent me the process as she was coloring, I would\u2019ve reminded her. I don\u2019t know why, but I apologized for her forgetting and she disregarded my comment again and sent me the updated art. She also never asked me what background I wanted and just chose for me. She sent the art with the background attached, and when I asked if she could send it separately (so the drawing and the background are separate) she said she would, but now she\u2019s ghosted me.\n\nIt\u2019s been about two weeks and she isn\u2019t replying to my messages.

What she give me was just a guy and a girl not holding hands and her head NOT on his shoulder. I don\u2019t know if she was having an off day or something, but that\u2019s why she redid the pose without charging extra. She also told me told me how many revisions I got, which I was within. And no, she did not present me with a contract, and I didn\u2019t know they existed because like I stated above, this was my first commission. I wanted the art to use on an app and she works mostly with clients who use that app as well. It\u2019s normal for them to send backgrounds and the art separately.

Art takes time, and a super common thing new artists do to themselves is undercharge for their time. She\u2019s probably is making well under minimum wage, especially since you\u2019re asking for all these revisions, and whatever you\u2019re paying her is just not worth it to her anymore. \n\nImo this is a learning experience for you both. \n\nBut here\u2019s my advice for you. Don\u2019t go with the cheapest option. When hiring an artist you want to go with someone who will use a contract.  This contract should include info like how many rough sketches they will do, and how many revisions they are willing to do, as well as a deadline and what happens if either of you doesn\u2019t hold up their end. The purpose is to set clear expectations for the both of you.\n\nAlso as a client, you need to be specific about what you want. Don\u2019t be all butthurt because she didn\u2019t ask about what background you want, that\u2019s your job to tell her up front. Same about wanting a specific pose. We ain\u2019t mind readers. \n\nAlso just because you compliment someone; they doesn\u2019t mean they are obligated to kiss your ass. Don\u2019t compliment someone for attention, you aren\u2019t owed it. A true compliment is something you should give freely without expecting a return.  \n\nSo what to do?  You could try to file in small claims. Any messages you\u2019ve sent can be counted as a verbal agreement which would hold up\u2026 maybe. She did deliver the work, and that fills her end of the obligation. There was nothing I can see in your agreement where you get multiple re-dos, so therefor I don\u2019t see your agreement holding up in small claims.   Even if you\u2019re successful, she may not have the money anymore. Is her ghosting you tacky? Yeah, but on the flip you sound like a poor client, and since she already did the work she likely realized she doesn\u2019t owe you more than what she has already given.  \n\nI\u2019d love to hear how much you paid for all of this.", "ups": 44, "depth": 0, "author": "notquitesolid", "replies": [{"selftext": "This.

And freelancing on the internet just isn't reliable; as a side job maybe, but as a main source of income it's not stable enough. Is this something you could make a minimum of $30,000/yr with? ($30,000 is not much, btw, it's just the bare minimum to be able to live)\n\nMy advice is to make a plan, a reasonable one. Build a portfolio, go to art school, develop your skills, make connections, and do your damndest to come out on top. Pick a major that gives you several options to fall back on if your first choice doesn't work out. For example, I'm in school for game design and I would love to end up working for my favorite game company, but I can also go into something less grand like graphic design, UI, or commercial software if it doesn't work out (game design covers all these specializations). \n\nIf you don't know about art school yet, there are ways you can test the waters in cartooning to see if it's feasible for you to pursue. You can publish a webcomic, start a Youtube channel, or collaborate with others on a project (Zines, visual novels, etc.). Hobbying can potentially turn into something more; you could get picked up by a company like Webtoon as an illustrator. But what I cannot stress enough is that if you want the best chance of making it professionally, you have learn professionally, and you have to take it very seriously. You have to be competitive. Very few artists are able to make it big simply by publishing works on social platforms, but there's nothing at all wrong with doing it just to have fun! I discovered my passion for art just by posting silly comics and enjoying people's reactions, and I still do it as a hobby, but I knew I needed to go beyond that if I ever wanted a true career in this field. \n\nIf you want your family to take you seriously, do your research.

I\u2019ve seen this with my own eyes, and the reality is that most people will not approve or accept your chosen path until you have actually made it successfully.\n\nRemember that it is only you that have that inner feeling/compass to tell you that you can make it.

But when I started to make my packing list I realised that I don't have any art supplies packed with me (apart from a pencil and an eraser). I then added my digital drawing tablet, but I'm more of a traditional artist and love painting but taking my acrylics with me is a bad idea. So I started to ponder if I should take my watercolours with me since they fit in smaller space. But then I also LOVE using alcohol markers, but I own like over 100 of them so I would have to go through them to choose only few to bring with me. Of course I also use my colour pencils so then I would have to bring them as well and then there is a graphite set that I also love using...\n\n\n\nSo as you can probably guess I just have a little problem with which stuff I should take with me and what to leave behind. It's gonna be a tough year without my supplies even if I'm a very inconsistent artist and make art maybe once a month. :') If there is anyone who has gone abroad for a long time or moved to a different town etc. and had to limit their art supplies please do share how did you manage!\n\nEdit:Thank you all so much for giving out awesome tips I will definitely keep them in mind. \n\nAlso for those who are curious I'm going to Japan, so yeah there probably will be new stuff that I can fall in love with such as ink!

Sometimes I have to cut myself off from social media where I can see others artistic preferences and art, because it will make me focus less on what I want to do and more on what I think others will want to see. At the end of the day people will want to see whatever you do, the fact you even had commisions is a good sign, however focusing so much on this will make you a perfectionist in a way that is detrimental to yourself.

I have been thinking of starting my own small tattoo business here in my uni city, where there's not much competition, as a means to make income as a student too. I feel like my motivation for wanting to make tattoos stems less from profit and more from the type of art I draw. It just happens to be pretty tattoo-able. So I'm starting off \"easy\" by already having a signature that it's appropriate for both paper and skin.\n\nIf you think you will struggle too much creatively or in general with tattooing, and you live in a big city where there's a lot of competition, then I'm not sure if it'll be worth it. My ex girlfriend did no tattoos but she was burn out after doing hefty commissions online, to the point that earning 1k\u20ac a month wasn't enough to save her from years-long artistic burn-out. It kind of killed art for her.\n\nI'm an artist who's specifically thinking of moving to Germany (perhaps with a chance at \"snapping\" a Master's program after I graduate from a university that's completely unrelated to art) and I feel like making your art impactful and memorable is the key to (profitable) success, especially in a market like Germany where, in my opinion, people appreciate 21st century artists more than a country like Greece does. It's key that big cities in general appreciate art with more ease because there's more chances for artists to exhibit their art and thus more people growing up to admiring art and appreciating its value. This applies both in-Greece (Athens vs, let's say Kavala) and Greece vs other countries.\n\nIt's difficult to make a random person buy a 150\u20ac original piece because art has no inherent transactional value, the value builds up based on the impressions your art leaves behind and the impact you make as an individual behind the artistic piece. Perhaps relying on your other degree for a stable income is the key to building a solid artistic career these days. \n\nThe other choice is to build yourself more online and less on exhibitions.

I used to be able to draw and feel so relaxed and free but now I try to draw something and I am constantly on edge, especially if I like how it's looking I'm so scared that I'll mess up. \n\nI think this is partially to do with the fact I have just done a fine art degree and we were encouraged (forced) to do really conceptual work, which isn't me at all. So I haven't draw for myself for years. \n\nI have been slowly trying to draw/paint more and I know practice helps. But I am just frustrated as art has always been my safe space and now I am tearful everytime I try. \n\nAnyway, anyone else experiencing something similar?

I must say my wacom is still going strong but I do have some issues with the shortcut keys and the occasional driver issues, otherwise the pen and the pad itself are working great. My birthday is coming up next month and I want to gift myself something for the first time. \n\nFor the last four years, I really wanted to upgrade to the Wacom Intuos Pro (small) but I read a lot of reviews saying the pen nibs wear out really fast, so I thought to wait till maybe Wacom fixed that or came up with a new product. But I recently came to know of the TourBox Neo and it caught my eye. It is on the expensive side but I was very impressed with it's functionalities as I love using shortcut keys and I think it'll really speed up my art process. Most artists on youtube reviewed it as a pretty solid product but all of them had TourBox send these to them so I would really appreciate if I could get the opinion of artists on here.\n\nThank you for reading through all of that and I would appreciate any input you may have! \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "ups": 1, "permalink": "/r/ArtistLounge/comments/16unobo/thoughts_on_the_tourbox_neo/", "num_comments": 11}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I got a TourBox Elite earlier this year when I went from ipad to a wacom tablet and then to a huion screen tablet.

I also don't have a lot of desk space so trying to use a keyboard while drawing is extremely difficult for me and is the main reason why I got a TB.\n\nI love the TB honestly, the buttons are responsive and for the most part are comfortable to use. I used it with Clip Studio and didn't have any issues with it working in CS. It took a bit of trial and error before I found a configuration of buttons that worked with my workflow. My issues with it are actually only with the Elite. The bluetooth connection kept disconnecting/resetting so towards the end I just kept it connected via wire... which defeats the purpose of getting the Elite (I did love the haptics on it but haptics alone aren't worth 100 additional bucks imo)\n\nSadly I've since moved back to the ipad (desk space made it even more difficult to use the huion and wacom tablets...) and it's not compatible with the TB, so I haven't used it recently. I miss it though since I could have a lot more shortcuts programmed than on my 8bit do.\n\nIf you use keyboard shortcuts a lot during your art process I'd recommend a TourBox.

Upon payment the artist said he would start around april of 2023 and revieced an alert around the start of june that he had started.   \n\n\nNow im not personally sure how long digital art takes but from that time untill now we still have not received any updates or have been told anything.

I was mesmerized by beautiful bodies and daydreamed how two bodies would look if they mingled together romantically, and I wanted to make that kind of art. Whenever I did, I felt guilty. *Very* guilty. I was supposed to be interested in another living person, and I wanted to make sexy art instead. \n\nBut eventually, I had an epiphany: The Bible doesn't condemn what I'm doing. For one, God made the human body and called it good. For another, it often dwells on how good-looking characters are (like Joseph in Genesis 39). Moreover, it describes sex and marriage in erotic language, and it uses similar language to describe the relationship between God and humanity. To top it off, the Bible uses sexual language all over the place. Some of it is downright pornographic (Ezekiel 23:20 is a case in point). \n\nYou've got nothing to feel guilty about. Your fascination with the body and with romance is normal, human, and God-given. If your art doesn't disobey any direct commands from the Bible, you can even think of your he-tiger and she-cheetah romance as an act of worship. Also, it sounds like your art is tame compared to what's in the Bible! If you're not creating anything sexier than Song of Solomon, you're probably OK. In any case, your guilt may be coming from Christians who don't know their own Bible, or from some Christian teaching that the Bible disagrees with.\n\nThat said, you still need to be careful. The Bible certainly condemns lustful behavior and sexual sin. Christians are called to run from any kind of sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18) and from anything that triggers youthful lusts (2 Timothy 2:22). So if you're planning to get married, you should probably tone your art down; if you don't, you could start pining after your characters instead of saving your feelings for a real person, and that could ruin a real relationship. \n\nI hope that helps!", "ups": 4, "depth": 0, "author": "UndergroundSkeptic", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "The human body isn't evil or anything like that, it's beautiful, I mean God created us this way.

I totally get your feelings! Especially my generation of millennials - it was shoved down our throat to not have sex until marriage and how horrible it was (let me tell you how much good that has done on a personal level! Insert eye roll.), but I feel like they went about it all wrong. You can teach holy and righteous sex without destroying the beauty and wonder of it.\n\nGod designed the human form after himself (remember that whole \"let's make man in our image\" bit?) and so beautifully. I love drawing bodies and faces and want to draw them every way possible to fully appreciate it. I just gravitate that way.\n\nThat being said, I definitely don't want to just start drawing porn or something. But romance is a beautiful form of love too, and eventually I'm probably gonna draw it. But I don't see it as lustful sin or something - just appreciating the beauty of what God made (and what he made is good, in the right context).\n\nAll that to say, study anatomy. Be in awe of the way the bones are constructed, the way muscles join and separate, the multiple twists and bends of elbows and wrists and forearms, the muscles of a neck, the flow of skin across a muscle group. There is so much to learn, and we were brought into this world naked in the first place.\n\nBtw, if you ever have questions, I'm happy to chat.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "laliad5", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Mate you have my blessing to make the lewd furry art.

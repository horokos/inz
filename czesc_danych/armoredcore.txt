{"post": {"title": "Rant post. Not worth my 70$ pre order.", "subreddit": "armoredcore", "selftext": "To preface this I'm not some newbie who's stuck on a boss. I beat ng++ the other day and only had to use a totally meta build on ibis first time around. Beat balty, spider and ibis pre patch. And I have to say. It's probably 80-90% of the player base that just brute forced almost all of the game and doesn't realize exactly how broken the weapon balancing is or how poorly designed the entire game actually is because \"they had fun and it wasn't that hard\".\n\nFromsoft gave us about 5-6 hours worth of a campaign (x3 for ng+ and ng++ so 15-18 hours total of a story) and something like an estimated 30+ hours of having to grind bossfights over and over and released it saying it has a 50+ hour estimated play time. That in its self is a joke.\n\nIt's been 10 years and the only mechanical improvement to the game they came up with was enhanced graphics? Really? Not to mention that they INTENTIONALLY implement mechanical inferiorities into this \"next gen\" game by programming in an un-changeable deadzone on consoles that's literally (not exaggerating) bigger than any other game I own. And INTENTIONALLY made the maximum manual camera speed on consoles slower than mildly fast enemies. Funny enough they incorporate the \"manual aim\" function as if you're going to be hitting some super accurate long range shots manually but good luck with the GIANT deadzone and inferior camera speed...\n\n Yea these bosses would be much more evenly matched if my highly calibrated super speed AC and it's augmented human pilot were able to keep up with my supposedly inferior regular human brain holding ps4 controller... but no apparently literal augmented humans and their ACs in their universe are somehow physically slower and less precise than me a regular human and my ps4 controller in reality... what a joke. \n\nIn all the old games it was something you allowed yourself to overlook if the games mechanics weren't perfect because the customization options and build varieties were vast and you could always build something completely different and know its going to be almost as viable as anything else. This is simply not true in AC6 because 7 or 8 weapons out of the hundred or so there are available happen to vastly out class everything else in their respective weapon types. This is EVEN FARTHER solidified by the fact that if you don't include duplicates of weapons parts (left and right variations) there's only a total of about ~240 parts. weapons and AC parts overall in the entire game. Leading to one of the lowest number of viable build possibilities in any of the AC games. Seriously it's been 10 years, wouldnt you think it'd been a better idea to include most if not all parts from previous AC titles save a few things like the super weapons and other things that would change the game mechanically. But no, instead they just copy and pasted a couple old parts and re-skinned a couple \"new\" ones and called that a finished product. \n\nPeople who really think of this as the \"best fromsoft game ever\" or even just \"best AC game ever\" are just dickriding fromsoft and have no clue how badly they've been scammed. The game was definitely not worth a pre-order as it's not even an actual upgrade in any way other than graphically from the games from 10+ years ago. \nPeople like myself who were really excited to finally get a next gen iteration of the Armored core games mostly are just happy to have a new AC game. That's fine but to claim it's some \"beautiful\" \"masterpiece\" of a game is laughable. just compare it to any shooter/action game of today. (Or if youre really a genius with atleast half your brain left you could just compare this game to the last AC game or even the game before that and it's blatantly obvious). \n\nGGs if you read this far that's my rant.

That in its self is a joke.  \n\n\nI'm not clear if you're saying you'd estimate spending 30 hours on boss fights or if you're talking about fextralife's \"lenght of the game\" section where they say they were told it will be around 50 hours long. I would agree that 50 hours is too high of an expectation to set. I've gotten hundreds of hours out of AC but I would not say it takes 50 hours to complete. So, assuming that's what you're talking about, yeah this is valid. A 20 hour complete time is still perfectly fine, devs should cave to pressure to inflate that number when speaking to journalists.\n\n\n\n&gt; It's been 10 years and the only mechanical improvement to the game they came up with was enhanced graphics?\n\nI wish that we had more innovation with combat at all ranges instead of getting the stagger system.

I get this point as well.\n\n\n\n&gt; Not to mention that they INTENTIONALLY implement mechanical inferiorities into this \"next gen\" game by programming in an un-changeable deadzone on consoles\n\nAgain, I have to agree with you here. I HATE the deadzone on consoles. This is becoming something of a trend with console games and aiming becoming even worse, but AC6 is the worst offender I've seen so far personally, though that comes with the caveat that it's also the easiest to play without worrying about how hard manually aiming is. I really wish we had the option to turn the deadzone down and to enable gyro aiming when in manual mode.\n\n\n\n&gt; And INTENTIONALLY made the maximum manual camera speed on consoles slower than mildly fast enemies.\n\nI have no idea what the intention of From was, but yeah, I really wish the camera could be turned faster.\n\n\n\n&gt; This is simply not true in AC6 because 7 or 8 weapons out of the hundred or so there are available happen to vastly out class everything else in their respective weapon types.\n\nThis is both true and false. Yes, AC6 needs either more part variety or more balance with the parts (particularly but not exclusively weapons) that it has now. BUT the game can be beaten with casual skills with pretty much any loadout you want, I have gone through the story about 30 times now and use different mechs every time, it's all doable.\n\n\n\n&gt; there's only a total of about ~240 parts.\n\nYep. Want more parts. We have a lot but you get through them pretty fast.\n\n\n\n&gt; People who really think of this as the \"best fromsoft game ever\" or even just \"best AC game ever\" are just dickriding fromsoft and have no clue how badly they've been scammed.\n\nI love this game, but it's not my favorite AC game. Most people who have played this game have not played other AC games because the series was on freeze for so long. I would definitely say its my second favorite AC game though, and arguing about whether or not it's \"the best\" just seems silly. AC6 is a good game. People will have their preferences from there -- that's not to say they can't be wrong, but to basically bucket them all into dickriders or clueless doesn't even leave the door open for other perspectives to be heard.\n\n\n\nHonestly, I was prepared to hate your post, but I do agree with a lot of your points, probably the majority, so I respect that. I still love the game I got but it definitely has issues and it seems like those just kept you from enjoying it more than they bothered me, and that sucks.

By 2008--when the U.S. was *still in Iraq*--*all* of Iraq's oil exports were paid for in non-USD currencies.

Like, the U.S. explicitly bans the use of USD for trade with Venezuela and Iran. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, while oil is obviously a very valuable industry, it isn't that important to the global prominence of the USD in world trade. Oil is a several trillion dollar per year industry; several trillion USD are exchanged on the FOREX *every day*. \n\nAnd, like, if the oil trade were so critically important to the USD and the role it plays in preserving US economic power, then surely something like, say, a massive drop in oil prices--like the one that occurred for a moment in 2020--would have an impact on the value of the USD, right?

A lot of newer fans think of it as the \"Moonlight Greatsword\" - a weapon in Souls games, and some other games here and there.

What is far less known is when that series died out, a sort of creator tool software came out around the same time, that allowed people to try their hand at making their own games like King's Field, it even giving them unlimited use of the King's Field IP, to the extent people could make fan games and sell them even. The software is called Sword of Moonlight.\n\nIt's kinda unthinkable in the gaming industry, isn't it, for a company to do something like that?\n\nThe Moonlight Sword is a very special symbolic thing, core to the company, and through that gesture, they were even willing to pass it on to the fans and independent game devs, to contribute to their original IP.\n\nBut you don't have to look that far back to see the passion they have for video games - the mere existence of Armored Core 6 is a testament to that. They found success in Souls, and instead of just becoming \"The Souls dev\" they were willing to continue their old Armored Core franchise, knowing that many of their new fans would not really want or like it, and that it is a niche franchise being met with a lot of new eyes on it scrutinizing it against their Souls games.

That's why Super Mario Bros is still fun, even though it's a 40 year old 2D sidescroller that couldn't be much simpler. A lot of other developers seem to focus on tech, spectacle, and following trends, while forgetting that the game has to *feel good in your hands.*\n\nReally it feels similar to playing an instrument to me. Once you get a piece of music down to the point where you can play it automatically and start focusing on making improvised, expressive changes to it while you play, that's how it feels to get the hang of a Fromsoft game.  Especially with the AC games and how fast they are, you start to feel like time stretches out and you can do more within the span of a second than you could in 10 seconds when you started the game.\n\nBut then of course, From also puts in the work to embed these satisfying game systems in beautifully realized worlds with a lot of care and detail poured into them, and stories that prod you to ask a lot of questions and think about the game world.

I'm going to give some clear examples at the bottom and hopefully you'll understand.\n\nIf you aren't building your mech for as much stagger as possible you're playing the game wrong by design. This means no ranged combat, of which there are no real ranged weapons anyway. No missiles. No laser weapons etc. Use shotguns , cannons and a pile driver or you're playing stupid.\n\nYou say it isn't like souls. I say it absolutely is.\n\nUnlike older games, this game is full of Dark Souls \"Haha player!!!\" nonsense. The biggest example is getting killed by \"gotcha\" tricks and kaizo traps on a first time play through. That's Dark Souls bread and butter.\n\n* Shit like the suicide drones blowing up the building within 10 seconds of spawning on the Xylem defense. If that building has half health, when those drones spawn at the 2 minute mark you've lost. You have no way of knowing they're coming first time through, and even if you did, without being exactly in the perfect spot with a grenade cannon you aren't shooting them down.\n* Another example is Sea Spider landing on you as soon as you activate the resupply, killing you or severely damaging if you dont move. You have no way of knowing this is coming the first time.\n* Another is take the wall mission where, while you have no long ranged weapons and never get any, enemies on the wall can and will snipe and kill you in the spawn if you dont instantly start moving. They are literal kilometers away. I don't think I have even one weapon effective past 500-800 meters. 95% of them are completely useless past 300 meters. Can you counter snipe them? No. Why? Because you just cant okay. Theres no long ranged weaponry.\n* Every mission exists for a boss fight that is the same thing every single time. The only time you'll die is the guaranteed death when the boss goes to a new phase you haven't seen before the first time through and kills you in one hit or wipes 70% of your health with no chance for you to react.\n* Just like in Dark Souls, bosses don't play the same game you play. With infinite stamina, breaking out of stagger instantaneously, ignoring overheat, ignoring jamming, infinite range for lock on etc.\n\nThe only cool bosses in the entire game are the bosses that are in the spirit of Armored Core. That is the ACs themselves, the Arena, the worm, the Strider. Everything else is just locked down. When I die to the bosses it doesn't feel like I'm playing Armored Core, it feels like I'm playing Dark souls.\n\nI'll give two more examples:\n\n* I didn't die to Balteus 2.0 because I got chipped by a laser rifle that did staggerless but consistent damage as I wasn't paying attention to my EN. I got killed in 2 hits by a circular sword beam that has a blade the size of an entire building and a hitbox thats 10x my size.\n* I didn't 1v5 the last NEXTs on the planet who can fight me and lose to the last man after killing 4 of them. I died because the enemy shoots a giant red laser beam that goes through walls and ignores armor and I had no way of knowing it ignores armor the first time encountering it.\n\nWhen I die in AC6 I don't feel outplayed, outsmarted, or out built if its one of its many, many dark souls boss fights where the bosses aren't even playing the same game. I just kind of feel like \"Well that was a waste of time\". \n\nIn all the other AC games I've played, this type of boss fight isn't present or is the minority.

{"post": {"title": "At my wits end with multiplayer. Am I playing the same game as everyone else?", "subreddit": "armoredcore", "selftext": "Been playing the game for quite a bit since release and I've found myself drawn more towards the multiplayer aspect than the single player as I've gotten most parts that I'm fine with having and I've gotten all the endings.\n\nWell, after having played over a dozen games and winning exactly zero of those games, I've come to the conclusion that there is some fundimental mechanics of the game that I must not be understanding. \n\nWhat I see in multiplayer has genuinely baffled me. I have seen ACs never stagger (going back down to zero when almost staggered), I have seen people tank Assault Armor, I have seen build have seemingly infinite energy (never ending boosts, infinite flight time). I have seen people melee me from hundreds of feet away. Is this the regular AC6 experience? I don't understand how everyone else's ACs can so vastly outperform mine in just about every way. Even builds identical to mine are able to perform feats mine can't even come close to.\n\nIs there an AC part meta I don't know about? I've tried seriously everything and nothing works against even the most basic of builds in the game. My shots never land regardless of FCS (missiles especially) and my stagger meter builds so quickly on even the heaviest of my builds and it seems that every AC I have gets stagger comboed to near instant death no matter what. It's really killing every enjoyment I am getting out of the game not being able to do the things other people's ACs are doing.\n\nIt feels like I am playing the game on hard mode compared to everyone else. All of my builds feel super awful to play and at this point I don't really know what else to do. I've tried looking up guides that explain parts and how they synergize and despite building and tinkering for hours my weapons and AC fail to perform like everyone elses. Is this really it for multiplayer? Am I experiencing the exact same dreadful gameplay everyone else is? Is this PvP just not for me? Is it really stagger build or suffer right now?\n\nI'm really wishing I got to play AC4A multiplayer right about now.", "ups": 5, "permalink": "/r/armoredcore/comments/16q8lg9/at_my_wits_end_with_multiplayer_am_i_playing_the/", "num_comments": 32}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I'll go through the frustrations you've listed and see if I can provide some clarity or pointers.\n\nIf your bullets aren't hitting even when in ideal range and with the red reticle locked on, test your guns with various arms to make sure that your recoil control is actually able to keep them accurate. Even with low recoil weapons, some of them are actually less accurate with the Nachts than with the Alba arms because the recoil control is just so bad on them.\n\nSecond, certain things like laser or bullet weapons and all melees use attacker side net code, so it can look like things missing you hit but if you hit on your screen you do damage regardless of what the opponent sees. Missiles and other high tracking weapons use defender side, so it may look like your missiles are completely whiffing due to latency but still hit because it's only what happens on the enemies screen that matters. This is just an unfortunate reality at the moment, as it will occur at high latency, and there is no way to check your latency with a player prior to loading into a match with them. It is frustrating, but if you notice it happening to a ludicrous degree, leave and try to find a player with a better connection. This just genuinely sucks and I hope they do something to address it, even if that is just letting you see latency prior to starting the game.\n\nInfinite flight is easily achievable when using generators with a high Post-Recovery EN supply. This is the stat that determines what value your energy will be set to at the start of recharge after being drained completely. The coral generators and the VP-20 Series are the best for this. Using the VP-20C with the Gridwalkers will give easy infinite flight to most bipeds, but this isn't always particularly good since quick boosts in the air are inherently worse than grounded ones due to the jump distance stat on legs. \n\nAs for Assault armor being tanked, this could either be because the enemy has more stagger than it does since it only does 2k and heavy builds can have more stability than that. Alternatively, while charging a core expansion, you have heavy resistance to Assault armor. This means that if you are using Assault armor first and the enemy responds by using their own, you will almost always lose that trade. They may just be out of range and not appear like it due to latency since I believe Assault Armor is defender side.\n\nAs for people losing stagger, there are two types of impact damage in the game. The first is regular impact, which will vanish quickly around a second after it is applied. Then, there is accumulated impact. This is the value that sticks around for several seconds even after the initial impact degrades. This will stay on the enemy for around 4 seconds or so before it starts to drain, with this timer resetting every time they take damage. The Pulse Armor expansion also has the effect that it completely purges your stagger bar when it is activated.\n\nWhile currently stagger is very Meta with Zimmermans and big punish guns like Stun needles or Melee weapons like the Laser Dagger or Pile Bunker, missiles and laser builds are still extremely competitive.

I won't say much about the weapon balance, cause I think that is very obvious to anyone how some weapons just outclass others (The main offenders being the obvious Zimmers, laser drones, coral shield, plasma missiles, stun guns. etc. etc.)  \n\n\nOther than the weapons. Heavies (especially quads) just do everything too well, there's no place for lights/mediums. Yes, you can still win with a light/medium, but you'll have so much easier time just playing a heavy since they have no downsides. Since the combat is **extremely** focused on stagger, builds that have high attitude stability (so heavies and especially quads) are just flat-out better than anything else. They also get the obvious more AP, higher damage resistances, more firepower, better weapons, better generators, etc. **granted these benefits heavies should have**. Playing a heavy **should have the downside of low mobility**, but Assault Boost completely invalidates that.   \n\n\nAssault boost is completely busted, there's 0 downside to it. Assault boost is your best movement ability, best offensive, and also defensive move. It's the fastest and most efficient way to move, gives you MORE damage and you take LESS damage. There's no downside to just constantly Assault Boosting everywhere, which makes lightweight builds obsolete. You can't kite a heavy in AC6 due to Assault Boost, and coupled with the unbreakable lock-on, you can not outmaneuver them either.  \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the game, had tons of fun S ranking singleplayer and doing lots of PvP, but outside of playing with friends with whom you can agree on build limitations, the current state of the balance in PvP is pretty bad, and not worth the headache.", "ups": -10, "depth": 2, "author": "ReelRai", "replies": [{"selftext": "Why are they down voting you?

I think the stagger system needs bigger reworking to work well, as I think just increasing/decreasing the stagger of different builds won't fix the issue, you would have to make the stagger on lightweights nonexistent and stagger on heavies last forever, but then again, that won't be fun for either party either.

The real unknown is Coral Release, where anyone within range of it is transcended presumably beyond human limits - but since the ending in question is so vague, we can\u2019t really tell if it\u2019s a good or bad thing. That all said, Coral can be contained by burning it unlike Kojima particles, it just is an extremely destructive process. \n\nIn regards to tech, Kojima Particles provide an insane amount of power output and Coral does similar, but arguably to a much lesser degree. To make up for this though, Coral doesn\u2019t pollute wide areas with minimal exposure, and provides a stupidly good data conduit and power source, which essentially allows for the insane feats of augmented humans enhanced with Coral. It\u2019s essentially like a room-temperature superconductor combined with a nigh-endless power source. \n\nTo summarize, on a planetary scale, Coral is arguably the safer option and generally more useful overall, while on a cosmic scale Kojima particles pose less of a threat from what we know and the pollution would be minimal if confined to space usage\n\nAt the end of the day though, I\u2019d go with the option that gives me a brain wife and the ability to get high off my ass over something that makes entire planets uninhabitable for basically all of time with only a few years of extensive use with no way to fix it.", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "master_apprentice37", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "kojima particles hands down.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "Mega1987_Ver_OS", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "One gives you death, other straight up turns into a fucking.... idk what you call it, if they reproduce too much.

{"post": {"title": "Regarding Snail's plan and Maeterlinck", "subreddit": "armoredcore", "selftext": "So there's a good chance everyone already thought of this, but I felt like posting it in case there is something I missed or someone has a better idea/version than mine, or just to entertain someone who this theory may not have occurred to.\n\nI was thinking of Maeterlinck's death (and how damn sad it was) when it occurred to me that the reason she was calling for Snail specifically is because she knew he was nearby. This led me down a train of thought which basically ended up like this:  \n\n\nSnail is a cold bastard, but he had a plan. He needed access to the Coral and the station to pump it. He may not know what defenses it had exactly (or maybe he had already found out it was Ibis), but with all of the Institute automatons running around, it had to have something. So, he needed a way to crack it. From what we see of their relationship, Snail and Freud are antagonistic towards each other at the best of times, so its possible Snail didn't want to involve him, or he was away on another mission. That means that there was only one other person Snail knew which could handle the truly absurd defenses a place like the pumping station would have: Raven.\n\nNow, at this point it is obvious to everyone involved that Raven (or, at least, Walter) has their own designs for the Coral, and so Snail couldn't trust them to act in Arquebus' best interest if he attempted to hire them. And, with Raven's track record of showing up wherever Coral shenanigans are happening, it was a safe bet Raven would be at the Convergence sooner or later. \n\nWhen Raven arrives, it is natural to expect Arquebus to have deployed in strength to secure the area, so a total lack of presence would be a large indication of something being strange. To prevent Raven from sensing a trap, he needed to camouflage it. A squad of MTs would obviously not be trusted with such a valuable and dangerous mission, but a Vesper would. Which one, though, was a bit more of a finicky subject. As mentioned, Freud would have probably expected something from Snail due to their (in my opinion) apparent animosity, Rusty was AWOL, and many of the others were dead, wounded, or otherwise preoccupied (Swinburn possibly being \"re-educated\" for his failure.)\n\nThe description for Maetrlinck states she is \"unfailingly loyal\" and \"risk-averse.\" Why would an elite AC pilot, known for not taking risks, be deep in hostile territory (She even states as you approach that she doesn't think she has the resources to win the fight just against the defenses) with only a recent turncoat as an ally? The only reason I can see someone naturally cautious being in this scenario is because of her loyalty to Arquebus causing her to not question orders. When Raven arrives on the scene, sees a Vesper engaged in the defenses, they (and Walter) assume that Arquebus is committed. They suspect no foul play.

The game is fun and I want to keep playing, but there just isn't enough for me to do. Replaying the same story missions over and over isn't much to get excited about when I already know everything that's going to happen.\n\nHonestly, I think the moment-to-moment action and AC customisation are fun enough that they could fit into just about any kind of game format and it would still work. If FromSoft had wanted to dip their toes into the live service/open-ended grindathon genre, this game has enough going for it that I would have been fine with that.\n\nFor reference, I'm picturing something more along the lines of Deep Rock Galactic. I don't want Diablo loot drops, gear scores, or shitty pay-to-win/pay-to-skip microtransactions. DRG's current approach of free season pass updates that are funded through optional cosmetics would be ideal.\n\nIn my version of AC6, all the big story stuff would be stripped out. No secret agendas, no save-the-world nonsense... just straight forward, cynical merc work in a world populated by a fun cast of characters. The plot is the weakest part of the writing in this game; all you need are the NPC personalities backed up by the excellent voice acting performances, and the game would be just as enjoyable (again, see DRG for reference).\n\nSo, the new story - Walter and 621 head to Rubicon purely to capitalise on the Coral War. Once you arrive, you have to complete a series of tutorial missions to validate your merc license with All Mind. Each one introduces you to a different procedurally generated mission type - take out enemy defences, retrieve data from wrecks, defend a friendly base against waves of enemies, survey an abandoned Institute facility... just general jobs that the factions on Rubicon would hire you for.\n\nThe final tutorial mission would be for boss fight-type missions (e.g. \"Eliminate advanced weaponry\") where you have to kill a prototype Juggernaut or Cataphract that has limited attack patterns - some kind of baby mode boss that's suitable for a tutorial. At some point in the mission, a freak accident occurs with the Coral, and you make Contact with Ayre. She would play the same role as she normally does - a secondary support NPC that provides warmer, friendlier interactions in contrast to Walter's cold pragmatism.\n\nOnce you finish the tutorial, you can start working for the factions in earnest. Every job you complete for a faction (Balam, Arquebus, RLF, RaD) rewards you with currency and boosts your reputation with them. If you were fighting against a rival faction, you lose some reputation with them as well. As your rep goes up with each faction, they start to offer you more rewarding jobs. Eventually, they start to give you special assignments that reward faction-specific currency, which can be used to purchase more advanced parts that are manufactured by each faction. Over the course of the game, you'd have to juggle your rep with each faction in order to obtain every part, or you could just pick a side and play their missions for the fun of it.\n\nNew season pass updates would add additional parts and cosmetics to collect, along with a mini-story arc that involves some more specially-tailored missions and boss fights. Maybe there are more giant C-Weapons like the Ice Worm that get revealed over time, and destroying them actually releases the \"Coral voices\" instead of killing them. These seasonal stories would provide the opportunity for more character-focused moments with the NPCs, maybe a few more cross-faction team ups, and of course the chance to make Ayre feel all warm and fuzzy by helping to free her brothers and sisters.\n\nIf you wanted to get really crazy, you could also add in some kind of For Honor/Planetside 2 conquest system, where each faction is battling over different regions on a global map and completing missions for them helps them to seize territory. Link that up with other players around the world, and now every \"Raven\" is helping to tip the scales of the war one way or another.\n\nObviously a game like this would be a huge departure for the series and would definitely alienate some people. I generally prefer shorter, more straight forward games, but AC6 ends up being a bit too short and straight forward for the amount of potential it has. I think it could have gone bigger and been just as successful, if not more so with the right people and decisions behind it.\n\nP.S.

I purchased a Fluval Flex 15 on the advice of the fish guru at our local fish shop, and it is currently cycling with no fish in it yet.  It\u2019s a beautiful tank and I am excited to have some little fish friends again, but I have a couple of practical questions about the specific tank.\n\nFirst, am I supposed to fill it high enough that water is able to reach the higher of the two inlets on the back wall?  It seems like that would make the most sense, but I\u2019m worried that fish might jump up and bonk themselves on the lights if I fill it that high.\n\nSecond, my daughter really really really wants a mystery snail.  I\u2019m worried that because there is a small gap between the back wall and the filter compartment, the snail might crawl up and over into the filter chamber or even out of the tank entirely through the gap where the wires run.  Am I overly paranoid, or could an average size snail manage that?  I\u2019ll definitely be covering the food opening on the tank hood with something to prevent escapes, but I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019d need to worry about the gap leading to the filter chamber too.\n\nThanks for any insights!", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "Mandze", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "I'm getting back into it after being out for years and years.

I shudder to think what we used to do to our poor fish, and wonder how any of them lived for years as they did. (And my days as a kid? We're talking 30+ years ago)\n\nI want to get into White Cloud Mountain Minnows, but I'm having a bit of difficulty understanding what they need as a tank set up.

Regular or rectangular tank, and what for substrate?

When there's just a few of them they're more likely to hide and look for nooks and crannies to cram themselves into, but if you get like 10+ or add a ditherfish they tend to be more confident. They're very friendly little fish so you can use almost any dither - I usually use a male guppy.\n\nAll the stuff about substrates are just... stupid things people spread to validate their opinions, every fish is subject to these silly myths. It really isn't impactful to that degree except where it has indirect relationships with the ecology of the tank, like it's ability to support plants and microfauna etc. I've kept a tonne of white cloud minnows in tanks laid in variously with sand, dirt, gravel and lava rock, they honestly don't even interfere with the substrate much except to scavenge for food and to lay their eggs in it.

Your progression sounds a lot like mine: I have a few low-tech tanks bursting with Anubias and crypt varieties, and a rotating Hi-Tech setup with CO2, red plants, etc. I'll try my best to weigh in in order. \n\n(1) Can't help with the pH probe question. I've used them a fair bit in a lab environment, and found them to get miscalibrated quickly. But I was using cheaper models to pH test a variety of weird solutions, so a dedicated aquarium model may be more reliable. I can say that CO2 will absolutely fluctuate your pH, as the gas reacts with water to create carbonic acid. So adding some crushed coral or similar to the filter to help buffer against swings may not be a bad idea -- some of the more sensitive fish and shrimp I've kept in Hi-Tech really did not appreciate the pH swings.\n\n(2) I rarely use canister filters because I find them to be a pain to service regularly. I wouldn't think gas in the lines would be an issue so long as the intake wasn't near the CO2 injector, though it's possible the CO2 may precipitate out of solution as a gas in the canister itself and cause burping issues? Not 100% sure about that one. Personally, I like HOBs for their reliability, ease of use, and the fact they usually don't drain your tank if they fail in the way a canister can. \n\n(3) I use a simple Ceramic and glass diffuser, which works well. It does require periodic cleaning, which is a pain. I don't use in-line diffusers, but would totally be looking into it for my next diffuser to minimize how much maintenance I need to do.\n\n(4) For liquid ferts, I like the Aquarium Co-Ops Easy Green. Most I've used will get the job done, but I think that brand is among the cheaper ones. What I really love is using mineralized topsoil as a growth substrate, capped with fluorite or fine gravel. One of the big challenges with CO2 is keeping enough fertilizer available for your plants to grow. CO2 puts their growth into overdrive, and without tons of fertilizer, the plants will start to struggle and die. Mineralized topsoil is, so far, the best solution I've found to that issue. Other soil-capped methods or dedicated aquasoils are probably also good options, but I have less experience with those. \n\n(5) My Fluval 3.0 does great in a 30 gallon, which is taller than your setup. You'll be fine with that light, it's pretty great.\n\n(6) So many cool red plants, I'll shout out a few form my current setup. Favorite right now is Ludwigia meta, super red/pink/orange leaves, grows fast, very cool delicate look to it. Blyxa roban is a cool grass that takes on a reddish hue in Hi-Tech conditions. Variegated alternanthera reineckii is stunning, if a little slower growing. Pink flamingo crypts are gorgeous, also slower growing and the initial die-back is sad. On that note, while crypts are usually considered medium-light plants, I love colorful crypt species in Hi-Tech setups. Stuff like bronze Wendtii, red Wendtii, and Crypt becketii really start to show off some crazy colors with CO2 and high light. Red tiger lilies look awesome, they don't need CO2 but are great, hungry plants nonetheless. I also have some mini Amazon swords whose new growth is very dark red, lightening to a red-dappled green as they age, and those look awesome in a Hi-Tech setup (not essential for this plant, but cool nonetheless). Lots of Ludwigia and Rotala species bring out red and orange colors; as does Hygrophila pinnatafida, which is a cool plant with an almost rhizoming/climbing growth habit. \n\nAlright, I should stop now.

I made sure to monitor them closely and doing regular water changes (40%, 2 times a week) so there won't be ammonia spikes (my tank is heavily planted so it also helps a little), after a few days I decided to add 2 nerite snails to help with the algae starting to form.

After the fish's death I did another 70% water change to remove anything that might cause their illness in case I wanna add fish again. After that all of my snails seems lethargic and sluggish (well even for snail standards), after a few days they stopped moving completely, well after that I smelled the worst stench ever when I picked them up so I knew for sure they died.

Cut down on feeding. Fish waste comes from fish food, so less food = less waste. Fish can thrive on a surprisingly miniscule quantity of food.

If you're seeing ammonia at all, it likely indicates you have insufficient biofiltration for the amount of fish you have; or that your tank isn't cycled. Adding a prefilter sponge to your filter intake; and replacing filter media with higher surface area media (i.e. nylon pot scrubbers, ceramic rings, sponge) will support the growth of more ammonia-eating bacteria. \n\n3. Plants. I rely heavily on plants to keep my tanks clean. They can consume ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate as a nutrient source. You can use aquatic plants from a fish store or website; or even houseplants (i.e. Pothos, many philodendrons, monsters, tradescantia, etc) with their roots in the water and their leaves hanging out of the tank. \n\nOnly edge case I want to mention is if your tank has a low pH.

I've had persistent ick infections that lasted two weeks before all ich spots were gone, so your experience sounds normal.\n\nCan't tell you if adding the drops again too soon will harm your fish; but I personally would follow the package directions, and would only deviate if it had been over two weeks with no sign of improvement. In that case, rather than try a random dosing schedule, I'd try to purchase another medication (Ich-X is my preferred med). \n\nOne of the reasons for the gap in dosing might be that the medicine is more chemically stable than other options, and thus persists in the water longer. This would be a sensible goal given the ick lifecycle. That said, the recommended dose was likely calculated by looking at efficacy in treating ick, compared with mortality of sensitive fish at increasing dosages. Thus, the instructions likely represent a conservative dose, which will eventually treat ick without killing most sensitive fish. Unless you have a particularly sensitive species, your fish are probably fine. \n\nI would avoid feeding if the package recommends it. Sick fish aren't likely to be that hungry, and more food waste = more ammonia.

Someone even asked why I didn't just flush him down the toilet....\n\nI felt really bad and honestly didn't tell many people about it anymore, just my closest ones. My fiance was also heartbroken about losing that fish, and it helped that I had someone who was feeling it with me, even though some people made fun of it.

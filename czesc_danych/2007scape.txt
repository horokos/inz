This would probably be something that is easy to flag because normally it would be impossible to purchase more than one item every some-odd ticks, rather than instantly buying a bajillion items.\n\nSo I get that it\u2019s frustrating, but it is a pretty difficult problem that (IMO) is only easily solvable by implementing one of the popular third party anti-cheat solutions such as EAC. That would greatly increase the scope of permissions granted to whatever OSRS client you use though and I\u2019m not sure how well that would slot in to Runelite\u2019s OSS model!

Given BH's history and how PvP works, it is not a surprise that they take a harder stance with boosting there.\n\nIf you get friends (or a gp service) to carry you in a Raid for a kit, it does take away from the prestige of that kit but it doesn't hinder other players doing the Raid since you are in an instance. If you use alts to boost kills at something like Mole or KBD, you are still taking up 1 world the same as if you were just soloing it. But if you were selling kills in BH, then that does impact other players since for PvP every player has to be paired against another player and if 20% of the players are boosting, then 20% of the matches are unplayable. There are only a few BH Worlds too so it is not like you can just hop to another world to get away from the boosting like you might be able to in other PvP Minigames.\n\nThat said, I do think Irons getting boosting CoX uniques or such is also problematic, but that is more of a fault with how CoX's handles points and contribution. For some other types of boosting like a Torso, I don't see that being quite as problematic since if you were able to be leeched, you'd likely have been able to obtain it without leeching. To some degree you'd also expect carries to be part of an MMO; like it reminds me of how in GW1 you could pay players to ferry you across dangerous maps to unlock cities where you could buy armor and such.

It still takes a long time to get from level 80-99 hunter, but the rewards in the form of herbs, the pet, and the decent xp/hr make it a skill I've been having fun training.\n\nOSRS isn't just about grinding; it's about accomplishing goals and doing the things you find fun while doing them. Yeah, some goals are grindy than others, but at the end of the day, the content is usually fun enough (or chill enough) that it's bearable. I don't 3-tick teaks because I find chopping redwoods good enough for me, but I do tithe farms because I can't stand having to remember to do fruit/tree runs to level farming. Mining currently exists in a state where it's pretty much useless after level 85; all the fast methods to train it are incredibly click-intensive, don't give better rewards than just doing some pretty easy pvm content, and have gotten to the point that people are celebrating getting 25k xp/hr because they hate interacting with the skill in any other way.\n\nIf every single method of levelling all skills to 99 were rebalanced such that they all came out to the same rate of 140,000 xp/hr regardless of what you were doing/when it's unlocked, it would still take a player at least 2141 hours to max their account.\n\nThat's equivalent to fully completing all of the following games combined: \n\nThe Witcher Franchise\nThe Dragon Age Franchise\nBaldur's Gate 3\nSkyrim\nOblivion\nElden Ring\nDark Souls I-III\nDoom (2016) &amp; Doom Eternal\nFar Cry 3-5\nHogwarts Legacy\nThe Mass Effect Trilogy\nPillars of Eternity 1 &amp; 2\nMetro 2033-Exodus\nSubnautica &amp; Below Zero\nShadow of the Tomb Raider\nWolfenstein the New Order\nPrey (2016)\nKingdom Come: Deliverance\nAnd Dying Light \n\nAnd at the end of playing all those, you'd still have ~50 more hours of games you could play before you'd have to spend the equivalent amount of time necessary to max your account.

Though to be clear, that's farther than where I'd ever go with buffing it; I think they should buff all the current methods by about 20-50% depending on how click intensive the method is, favouring increased xp/number of clicks and capping the xp/hr at a maximum of 115k xp/hr for high-intensity non-tick manip methods and 185k xp/hr for tick manipulation.", "ups": 1, "depth": 1, "author": "Bike_Of_Doom", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "The issue is this mentality that osrs is a job rather than a game.

You've created a variant of Forestry for mining and brought in a lot of community engagement in-game with this simple change. I've had some great conversations with people at stars in the first few days of star mining\n\n2. Other mining content is not dead; MLM gives you the prospector outfit, and VM and 2-tick granite both give faster experience. The pet rate at stars is also extremely low, which will push people to engage with other content\n\n3. The influx of gems from mining and stardust are minimal compared to DT2 bosses and other PVM content.\n\n4. It's not as AFK as you think, because you have to travel between different parts of the game frequently and click sometimes every 5-10 minutes at higher tiers of stars. Comparing this to the previous 25 min/6 hours that Duke mining offered.\n\n5. It's very important that you shape content around the fact that the vast majority of us are now adults, and we really value being able to play the game a little more passively while we get some study or work done, and the occasional chat with other players at stars makes the skill a lot more enjoyable.\n\nA very select few may be bringing up conversn about star mining now, but it's important that you listen to the community as a whole when making any future changes.

People will point to NMZ and splashing, but that content is also unbalanced and (in my opinion) should be changed. Just because some unbalanced content exists, doesn't mean there should be more of it. You say it's not as AFK as it seems, but you can simply open up a link, pick a couple easy to reach locations, and check the link for stars at your location. It takes a couple minutes or less to set up, and can lead to 1-2hrs of XP with only a few clicks. The XP rates aren't necessarily the problem, rather the effort to XP ratio. Saying it's \"not as good as duke\" doesn't really matter, because that method was never intended to exist anyways. \n\n3. Shooting stars were already fairly well balanced for solo miners/small groups, with the exception of CCs crashing them. I do think having some sort of change so that CCs can do stars effectively while also allowing solo miners to reap extra benefits for their effort is a good idea. However, that's not what we got.

You don't even have to interact with a person at all to do this, simply pull up a website that tells you where a star is, go there and mine, and go AFK.

The best way to revive mining is to give it the forestry treatment. Yes mining has many minigames, but these all suck and don't address the major issue with how slow and clunky the skill is.\n\n\nFirst change has to be the way ore depletes. Currently mining a single ore depletes most rocks making mining highly competitive and not very social, as well as highly click intensive for little to no gain. All rocks under runite should provide multiple ores per rock, simular to how trees give more logs at high tiers. This will not only ensure a less click intensive social friendly method to mining, but raise xp rates slightly which mining desperately needs.\n\n\nIt makes sense that the more people mining an ore vein, the faster you'll mine it. An up to +10 buff when mining with a group should give incentive to seek other players to mine with, which is healthy MMO 101. \n\n\nNext would be to include optional mining events like forestry.

And welcome back :-)\n\nMy first advice would be; take it all slow and easy. The great thing about (oldschool) Runescape is that it doesn\u2019t matter what you do; pretty much everything you do will slowly progress your character!\n\nQuests will slowly introduce you to anything that\u2019s new or whatever you may have forgotten in this time.\n\nSecondly; ironman/hardcores can be a great challenge and alot of fun, but I would not recommend getting back into the game with any of such challenge-modes. Just make a normie main account, and see where your interest lies.\n\nOther than that; there\u2019s a tutorial/guide on literally everything on both youtube and wiki.\n\nLastly; and this may sound weird; but if friendly players offer to donate money or items I suggest you decline them. It takes away alot of the fun and work that makes Runescape enjoyable in long term. Getting a few mil while you are at a point where you don\u2019t need such money will make you feel more at loss and maybe even lazy.

Trading and being able to buy the items you want. The con aspect is that most activities turn into what\u2019s the best gp/hour. Why do x content when it\u2019s 1m/hour when I can camp Y content for 7m/hour. This depends on the individual obv and how you like playing the game. Something you prob don\u2019t have to worry about for a while anyway.\n\nPro to Ironman IMO is every item you get feels way more impactful. 300k dharoks helm on a normal account might feel like a shit drop, but on an Ironman that might be the final piece for the set. That\u2019s almost true for almost every unique item you get in this game. The con is it can be way more \u201cgrindy\u201d. You might have to do x amount of barrows runs for a set you want for example. End game burn out is a real thing. \n\nAs a main to iron person myself, enjoy the main.

Bank coaches and travel coaches picking up money and rich travelers from the trains would get held up by a local gang of highwaymen that operated out of a cave in the hollow. Whatever they stole would be stashed underneath this big, ugly, gnarled oak tree called the Devil\u2019s Rocking Chair. Legend says anything placed under the tree was under watch by the devil himself and could only be taken by the people who put it there. Anyone else was faced horrifying consequences.\n\nWell, the sheriff of the next town over finally managed to catch one of the members of this little gang and he told them everything about the hideout and the drop spot. He got himself a posse and they went out to investigate the guy\u2019s claims. Sheriff went out to check the tree and the rest went to the cave. When they reached the cave, however, there was nobody there and no sign it was being used. They waited for the sheriff to return, but he hadn\u2019t by nightfall. They searched the area, including the tree, but found nothing. Not even the stolen goods.\n\nA year or so later, a hunter in the woods found a body lashed to the trunk of the big tree.

So there's this place a couple miles from town that people call F.O.D. (Field of Dreams) where people go to smoke weed and party. There used to be a big oak tree there (until about 6 years ago) that had some kind of large metal thing embedded in it about 15 feet off the ground. It was just like this metal ring type thing. It almost resembled a bear trap with spikes. The legend was that they used to hang people there. \n\nAnyway, nobody from my town knows a lot about the local history before the 20th century... but about 10 years ago this group of volunteers randomly came here to locate and restore the tombstone of a Pro-Union guerilla fighter. The locals thought they were crazy at first because this was deep Confederate territory and nobody had heard any stories about Pro-Union fighters from this area. Well they found the grave and it turned out they were much more knowledgeable than any of the locals on this subject.\n\nSo, as we learned, my hometown was the only Pro-Union town in this entire part of Kentucky. While the entire region was Pro-Confederate, my town was settled by people from other areas that were Pro-Union. So this man named Elisha Owens started a company of Pro-Union guerrillas to fight for their cause, despite being surrounded by much bigger Confederate towns on all sides. Confederates regularly raided and attacked the town, setting ablaze everything in their path. Elisha lost his life in one of these attacks and, judging by the dates on the tombstones that were recovered, it appears as if his whole family died too, including a young child. \n\nIt turns out that all of this information was well-documented but we locals just weren't aware of it. Probably because this entire town was wiped out by Confederates. The few who survived fled. Upon looking into this further, there was at least one known hanging a few miles from town, but the exact location is not documented. That leads me to believe the legend about that tree with the metal thing may have actually been where that hanging took place. There's just no way to verify it and the tree was cut down about 6 years ago. There's also a bunch of tombstones in the local cemetery with no names that are from the era. Many are known locally to be the graves of slaves but many more could perhaps be Pro-Union fighters who died at that time.

They'd recruit lower-level people to steal certain items, but it looked like regular shoplifting, not an organized mob coming in all at once. However, these shoplifters were pretty subtle and sophisticated. They knew when they were most likely able to walk out, they'd do things like remove their license plates from their vehicles so we'd only have video images to try to identify them with, they'd rotate locations and never hit too many businesses so it was harder to recognize them, etc. But they'd hit a bunch of stores and steal specific items, which would then be moved to a central location. From there, the higher-ups in the organization would resell them in various ways.\n\nIt wasn't terribly uncommon for the cops and LP to recover $100k+ worth of merchandise in those locations and bust 10+ people at a time, at least according to the training videos we watched every week (and some court records I was able to look up, lol...my day job is in the legal field so sometimes I could figure out the exact cases they were talking about by searching public records).\n\nIt's a shitty deal for the individual shoplifters, because they actually did get busted a lot more frequently than the rings they worked for were.

Sometimes they will tell you a grade level, other times they will just say they're above or below average.\n\nFor example, when our daughter started in kindergarten, they told us she was \"at the grade level.\" At the end of the year, they said she was \"above.\" We moved to another state last year, and in her first semester of 2nd grade, we were told she reads at a 5th-6th grade level.\n\nPart of the reason they will say this is so that you know what sort of books you should have them read so that they keep progressing.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "capt_scrummy", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "The goal is to make sure we don't have kids graduating high school with only the reading comprehension of a small child (which would hamper their ability to function as an independent adult, since you often have to read things, e.x. contracts, bills, newspapers, etc.) \n\nSometimes this takes the form of explicit test, e.x. \"read a passage and write what it's about\" type things.\n\nOther times, it's less explicit, and takes the form of analyzing the curriculum itself. e.x. \"we've roughly assigned these books to these grade levels, so the ceiling of books that a child can understand is their reading level.\" This is far less precise, as books often target age ranges or grade ranges, but this kind of data is also more widespread and easier to access.\n\nAnother way to look at this is think of a topic, and imagine how textbooks for different grades would write about that topic. A common example is some basic science principle, such as photosynthesis. A textbook targeted for a first grader would just explain that (most) plants need sunlight and air, the textbook for the fifth grader would add that plants need carbon dioxide too, a high school textbook would explain chemical energy, a college textbook would breakdown cellular nutrition, etc.\n\nI could read at a college level by the time I was 10 years old. That doesn't mean I could read a whole college textbook as easily as an actual college student - I didn't have enough education or background information for that to work. Rather, it means if you took all those respective passages on photosynthesis (aka gave me the background knowledge/education a college textbook would naturally assume its students already have), then I could follow that all the way up to the passage extract from the college textbook and, despite the complexity, still read it (so understand the vocabulary and the longer, more complicated sentence structures), and more importantly I would *understand* it well enough to explain it someone else.\n\nThe most important takeaway from that isn't about my intelligence (I am a dumbass in many regards). It just means the school system no longer needs to worry about making sure I *can* read adequately, which meant they don't need to expend additional resources on me in this specific area.\n\n(A *lot* of core are measured or graded or tested this way.

Safety must be balanced with functionality and safety protection is considered to be like an inverted pyramid. Under the [Hierarchy of Controls model](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html) the most effective way to control the hazard is to eliminate its existence. We want electricity in our houses so this fails the functionality requirement. Next best is substitution. We could replace plugged devices with batteries, but those batteries also need to be charged (and the ewaste/environmental impact could be a conversation all of itself.)\n\nThe next level is engineering controls, and I\u2019ll be arguing this is the method used in the United States. Most outlets in the US don\u2019t have the tamper proof internal block, but even without them the access to power is strongly limited. An outlet has 3 holes. The two easiest ones to access- the round and the large slot- are *completely safe* assuming the building was wired correctly. Round connects to ground as an alternate return path in case of a fault (physical error). The large slot connects to neutral, which is tied to ground at the distribution panel. Without completely nerding out about electrical power distribution, the short version is that doesn\u2019t have electricity supplied through it. If we pretend electricity is water, both of these \u201choses\u201d are actually dry. The one \u201chose\u201d that is wet is significantly harder to access, making it less desirable to an self-destructively ignorant user (eg toddler with a fork.) Also, simply contacting supplied electricity isn\u2019t necessarily harmful. Harm occurs from being in the actual path of a circuit and has to overcome skin contact resistance. Dry skin is pretty resistant. Wet skin is much more dangerous and in wet environments our building codes call for GFCI outlets that shut off power in milliseconds when a fault is detected. \n\nA switched outlet is on the next level, an administrative control. The safety hierarchy considers this less effective than engineering controls because it is only as effective as the people using it. If I went to Australia and encountered your outlets I\u2019d probably think \u201cthis is dumb, I have to turn on an extra switch to make my vacuum work?\u201d and then leave those switches on. So now I\u2019ve easily overcome any safety benefit due to a shortsighted sense of convenience.

Family, friends, and anyone else who wishes to will gather together at the grave and have a small, brief unveiling of the headstone, generally followed by a meal/gathering.

I just did some quick googling and apparently it may be an old British holdover tradition that\u2019s since become a specifically North American tradition since Canada does it too. \n\nI know funerals have literally been called a \u201cviewing\u201d as far back as the 1800s in North America. Back then, the body would be laid in the front parlor of the family\u2019s house for visitors to come pay their respects. Back then, that Victorian style Death photography was common too. The culture just had a very different relationship with death and didn\u2019t view it as gross or scary the way we do now. \n\nAs someone whose family doesn\u2019t do this, I also found it somewhat strange until I started watching the Ask A Mortician YouTube channel. She\u2019s based out of California and does a really good job of explaining why her work is important to her and how seriously they take their job of preparing the body for the viewing.\n\nIt is a little morbid, but some stories were really moving. She says it\u2019s very common for family members to want to see their loved one one last time to say their goodbyes, especially if they weren\u2019t there at the time of their death. In some cases, the person lived alone and it was a few days before anyone found them. The mortician is able to hide signs of decomposition so the family doesn\u2019t have to see that. \n\nOr a young person living away from their parents tragically takes their own life and the mortician is able to prepare the body so the parents can see them one last time and see them as peacefully sleeping, which gives them comfort. \n\nI don\u2019t think I would do it, but I can understand how important that could be for someone.", "ups": 3, "depth": 0, "author": "Confetticandi", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Am I the only one here that was disappointed this wasn\u2019t about people getting buried in their cars?", "ups": 3, "depth": 0, "author": "Savingskitty", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "I've never been to one that was closed.

I'm just pointing out the systemic problems that can exist.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Taxes.  Good public transportation is really, really expensive.  Building non-intrusive public transportation (like subway systems or elevated rails, or roads with lots of bus-only lines) is really, really, really expensive.  Building fast, effective, quality, and safe *inter-metro area* transit is really, really, really, really expensive.  Just look at California's attempt to create one high speed rail system from LA to San Fran -- $105 BILLION dollars.  Those public transporation systems have to be supported by tax money.  And since many of those improvement projects are local, that means higher local taxes.  Comprehensive public transportation means running routes that are inefficient to that people can fairly have access.  (E.g., look at the post office -- it costs the same to mail a letter to a post office in Nowheresville, North Dakota, where there's hardly any volume of mail and you have to pay much more cost per mile to have that letter delivered, as it does to mail a letter from NYC to Washington DC.)  So if you want public transit accessible to all, then you're paying even more for inefficient routes.  Indeed, there are still taxes to be paid for road construction and maintenance, but they can be alleviated by use-based considerations (e.g., toll roads) and other efficiencies.\n\n\\- Reliability. (This is more of a personal disadvantage, but I'm trying to come at it from a systemic viewpoint.)  If your public transit isn't reliable, you'll have lots of delays and accidents.  These will not only be an annoyance for individuals,  it will affect your city's productivity and its chances to recruit major businesses to operate.  For example, if a plant has to have a certain capacity of workers to run, and there's no guarantee that the city's transit system will be reliable enough to get those workers there, then that plant isn't going to open in that city or locale.  Sure, there are construction, congestion, and accident issues with a vehicle-centered model, too, but those are more likely to be localized (just to a small part of a road, where an outage can affect a whole train line), and avoidable (you can take a different road in your personal car).\n\n\\- Crime.  People without the means to drive are more likely to take public transit.  People experiencing homelessness (whether short-term or long-term) are likely to take public transit to keep warm and cool, and are likely to take use public transit hubs for shelter.  These attract people who are addicted to drugs, have mental health issues, or are in extreme poverty.  Groups of people also attract heinous criminals looking to make a buck or do harm.  Public transit can intensify these issues and be a source of crime.  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/06/06/bus-denver-pendemic-violence/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/06/06/bus-denver-pendemic-violence/)\n\n\\- Cost to vehicular traffic.  In preexisting cities, putting in rail or dedicated, high speed bus lines, dedicated bike lanes, or the like, often means closing lanes that were previously used by vehicles.  That creates congestion at least in the near term, as the same amount of cars try to run on roads that have less vehicular traffic.  That causes slowdowns, traffic jams, increased likelihood of accidents, and increased pollution from idling cars.  The increased congestion and decreased access for vehicular traffic may have negative consequences for neighboring businesses:  Foot traffic may increase slightly, but businesses that rely on drive-through or other large vehicular interest will see losses.\n\n\\- Planning considerations.  Where robust public transit gets placed can really affect a city's growth.   Choosing where to put a public transit station or hub can affect teh growth of a city or neighborhood, and there are chances of inequitable distribution or corruption when landowners conspire with government officials to get preferential treatment. On the other side, poor placement of public transit can result in the transit fizzling and money being wasted. If you put a light rail stop in a community without any other public transit options, and only big box stores for commerce, that light rail stop isn't going to get used because there's insufficient \"last mile\" transit options.", "ups": 0, "depth": 0, "author": "Perdendosi", "replies": [{"selftext": "wow, very thorough write up.

For those that don't understand what that means, it's a more dedicated train line that makes much less stops and goes faster.

So for me it's around $5 rather than the $3 for the subway. That $2 is worth it, trust me.

The venue was a swanky place in Chicago, and the families are well to do Catholics, but the ceremony was a civil wedding(Most Irish Catholic(or in the case of my cousin, German Catholics) families in America are very loosely religious, and college trained Catholics don't marry in Churches anymore. Chicago is incredibly annoying to drive, and the area more resembles Amsterdam in city density than the much younger neighborhoods of North, South and West Chicago.\n3.

The Bride and Groom had a lot more control of the guest list than my parents generation, and for that I do credit the Mother of the Bride and the Father of the pride who did not consider this a moment to summon all of their business and personal freinds and relations\n5. About 60% of the attendees were various family members, 20% were the Bride and Grooms friends the rest were friends and business relations of the parents of the couple(the Grooms mother passed two years ago, but since the groom's mother's sister also married his father's brother, his aunt had managed to invite his mother's friends)\n6. my brother and I had to leave the dance floor very quickly as did our elder Veteran relatives, hearing damage among veterans is very common, and  tennitus makes even moderately loud music an unbearable noise. This was well understood by everyone there.\n7. Our mother is mobility impaired, so my brother and I had to return her to the hotel four hours into the wedding reception, from what we understand the bridal party and the younger guest and surprisingly the three parents of the bride and groom had an after party, and my normally teetoling first cousin(grooms father) was absolutely shitfaced to the amusement of his three brothers, and my mother(his cousin).\n8. The Bride and Groom wisely decided to have sunday to themselves before departing to Italy the Monday after the wedding.\n9. Immediately after the wedding was a cocktail hour, and Shrimp and Calamari were served(Calamari apparantly is a shared vice between both families) about 30 kg of Fried Calamari was served. It was an open bar(basically only baptists don't have alchohol at weddings)\n10.

I\u2019ve lived in many states in the South but I\u2019ve lived in the panhandle of Florida for the longest amount of time, but I now study in a University in the northwest. I was chatting casually with a friend and asked him, \u201cWhat did you make on the assignment?\u201d He told me and then kind of chuckled and was curious as to why I phrased it like that. He said that saying \u201cwhat did you make\u2026\u201d rather than \u201cwhat did you get\u2026\u201d sounded weird to him and that he had never heard that before. Of course I have said the latter before, but I usually say the \u201cmake\u201d variant. I also would say in response to a question like \u201cwhat did you get on the assignment?\u201d with an \u201cOh, I made an 85.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe ate two plates!\u201d\n\nI was in my Spanish translation class and the professor brought up some translations for an exercise. It was basically some sentences in Spanish that displayed why you cannot literally translate everything from Spanish to English. One of the examples was \u201cSe comi\u00f3 dos platos\u201d which translates to He/she ate two plates which refers to a quantity of food portions and is totally normal in Spanish. My professor (a native English speaker) asked the class \u201cwould we say in English that we ate two plates?\u201d Thinking this was a trick question, I replied with, \u201cYes!\u201d and my friends said \u201cHuh?\u201d in confusion basically exclaiming that what I said was odd. They explained that they wouldn\u2019t ever say that, while I explained that my family and I and everyone I know back home would say something along the lines of \u201cDamn, he ate two whole plates!\u201d If they were surprised at the quantity of food someone ate, or I would say, \u201cI ate two plates.\u201d in response to someone asking me how much food I ate.\n\n\nThese things really surprised me as I had no idea that these things weren\u2019t said by everybody.

I definitely don\u2019t think the flight and expulsions of Germans after WW2 was at all justified. Murder and ethnic cleansing on the part of Nazi Germany does not at all justify the large scale ethnic cleansing of Germans. And if anything, at least amongst the main Allied powers (Britain, US, and the USSR) territorial cessions had less to do with answering to the Holocaust as opposed to ensuring that Germany would not become a major geopolitical hegemon in Europe again. The scale of violence accompanying the expulsions were also very high. While figures like 2 million which were cited by the West German government probably don\u2019t have much basis, it is likely that perhaps ~500,000 died during the expulsions.\n\nOn the second question, I would lean a lot more towards no then yes. Nazism as an ideology differed significantly from Prussian Conservatism in many important ways. Additionally, the Nazis drew support from a lot more than just Prussian voters. While rural Prussians were a strong Nazi demographic, the Nazis won a substantial share of rural Protestants more broadly, and won a reasonable share of Industrialists, large landowners, white collar workers, small business owners, Tory workers, urban/small town Catholics, and others. Richard F Hamilton has an interesting book on the subject. But Nazi support in general cannot really be simplified to one segment of German society.\n\nAs for the last question I would argue against the notion that the existence of the German Empire and its ideology made WW1 inevitable.

Christopher Clark especially pointed out that Germany just another ingredient in the poweder keg that Europe was at that time\n2. Some people claim that Prussian authoritarianism laid the root for the Nazis or even a contigency line from the second to the Third Reich. I don't buy that. On one hand was Nazism by all standards a very radical ideology and could not take over with the right coniditions e.g. treaty of Versailles and the Grear Depression. The Weimar republic surely suffered from a lack of organically grown democratic institurions and culture. But this did not mean Nazism was inevitable, but maybe the demise of the republic. Yet this could have played out in many ways.  \nAlso fun fact Prussia was actually an Anti-Nazi stronholg in Weimar Germany for most of its existence being conservative but still not keen on Nazis. \n3.

I like to add cumin and anything else that sounds food in the moment, too.\n\nToss the chex mix in the butter mix and then bake it low and slow (about an hour at 250F/120C) to until its good and crunchy again. \n\nIt is delicious, make it as spicy or mild as you like. \n\nSide note: It's called trash because when you make BIG batches for parties and stuff some people would just dump it all into a clean trash bag and shake it to coat everything in the butter mix. Probably not a good idea with all the deodorizer and stuff they put on the bags now but still the name.", "ups": 29, "depth": 2, "author": "azuth89", "replies": [{"selftext": "I'm old enough to remember when that WAS Chex Mix.

The Emperor has the ability to bestow his power to those around the galaxy. It used to be a rare enough occurrence for this to be called miracles among his followers, but since the opening of the great rift his ability to project his power across the galaxy has grown. It's still relatively rare in the grand scheme of things to see a manifestation of his power, but it's happening a lot more than I used to.\n\nThese generally manifest within people who are more devout, but there's plenty of evidence of people who are exceptionally devoted being 'skipped' for someone else. The reality is more likely that those who are devoted are easier conduits for the Emperor's power. In the case of regular miracles my personal theory is that their faith is strong enough (especially when gathered together like when the sisters of battle go to war) to tap into the Emperor's latent power, rather than him consciously giving them abilities. In the case of major miracles, living saints etc, where his power appearing is clearly more deliberate I imagine the Emperor doesn't give two shits about your faith: you just happened to be in a place where he needed to exert some control and your faith allowed him to do so", "ups": 1, "depth": 1, "author": "kirbish88", "replies": [{"selftext": "wow, thank you for the elaborate answer.

He might have some general love or care for humanity way deep down, but when you've been alive for tens of thousands of years, died, been interred on a psychic torture chair for 10,000 years and fed millions of psykers while being simultaneously bloated into a nascent god by worship your perspective of things changes a little. Having said that though, he's always been a master manipulator. His means justify his ends, anyone else's be damned. \n\nAlso just a heads up, what's happening with the Tyranids won't really be an 'arc' in the traditional sense. Each edition tends to have a big threat (conveniently it tends to be from a faction receiving a range update that edition). There's usually a bit of story that revolves around that, mostly told via campaign books and codexes for the game and perhaps a novel or two, which will lead to something fairly big happening (which might itself have some big lore ramifications) but causes things revert back to the status quo as a result. The Tyranids won't kill the emperor, or if they do it will be in some way that somehow ends up with him still being interred on the throne. 40k is a setting that narratives happen within, not a narrative itself. Whatever happens the setting always looks more or less the same: all factions unable to topple one another, leading to endless war\n\nEdit: also if the faith of the emperor stuff interests you I'd recommend reading the Dark Imperium trilogy (Dark Imperium, Plague War, Godblight).

It is especially interesting as these darker aspects seemingly have noble intentions behind them. \n\nWhile you could argue that the Imperium is an authoritarian state, the Ultramarines have their unique brand of autocracy which involves Space Marines ruling over human populations. Of course, this is done in a more sophisticated and structured way than Horus would have done. Ultramar has a senate with civilian representatives and their input is taken seriously. However, it is the Ultramarines who have the ultimate authority in that sector. \n\nWhile most Ultramarines in positions of authority are trained statesmen who have centuries of experience with negotiation and diplomacy, every now and then you can see the authoritarianism slip out as shown by the excerpts below. In addition, they also seek total cultural domination, with the culture of Ultramar being imposed upon any of the worlds they conquer. \n\n*\"Of course, Calgar was an autocrat too, a minor emperor in all but name. That he accepted, though it was a burden to have to be so. He had hoped for better from the primarch. Although in his genius Roboute Guilliman excelled at everything Calgar could imagine, in other ways he was a world away from the idealised figure Calgar had imagined all his life.*\n\n*Autocracy was the natural order of human society.

I'd even say he's one of the more humble primarchs. A cursed object magnifying his flaws could work just fine as a story, but they didn't even bother planting the seeds for any of it. Horus's fall is similarly rushed, but you at least get hints of his personal motivations that then get multiplied by Chaos.\n\nIt's so easy to fix too. Just have somebody warn Fulgrim that the sword is cursed. An inscription in the Laer temple, or even some random old weirdo. A tiny change, and suddenly the story is about Fulgrim causing his problems by arrogantly dismissing the warning. Not something that feels completely random because he just found a sword and thought it looked pretty. I like to compare him to Arthas of Warcraft fame, because their stories share some similarities but Arthas is handled so much better. Arthas is also son of the sovereign with bright long hair, beloved by his people and eager to prove himself. He also falls to evil by picking up a sword that influences his thoughts. There are some key differences though. Arthas is desperate to save his kingdom and get revenge on his enemies. He becomes arrogant, thinking he's the only one willing and capable enough to save his people, and dismisses the advice of his mentor and friends. He is warned that picking up Frostmourne will cost him dearly and that the sword is cursed, but consciously decides to do it anyway. Meanwhile, Fulgrim is just out there crusading with no real personal motivation, only because the Emperor told him to. He has no reason to be suspicious of the Laer blade, because the Emperor has been hiding the truth about Chaos from him and the Laer just seemed like any other xenos race. It isn't the result of a character flaw that he picks up the blade. It's not arrogance, desperation, vengefulness,... just \"ooh, pretty\".\n\nAnd I think the writers realised how poorly it was handled, because they tried to somewhat retcon it by saying Fulgrim was possessed and the real Fulgrim was still around somewhere. A bit of a cop out, but at least it gave them a second shot at doing the fall of the real Fulgrim. Maybe he gets his body back and is horrified by what the daemon did while posing as him, and discovers people hate him now, which makes him vulnerable to Slaanesh's offers?\n\nNope, they decided his story wasn't a big enough mess and they retcon the retcon by going \"forget all that, it was actually Fulgrim all along and he just really loves being evil for no reason\".", "ups": 20, "depth": 3, "author": "cestquilepatron", "replies": [{"selftext": "&gt;And I think the writers realised how poorly it was handled, because they tried to somewhat retcon it by saying Fulgrim was possessed and the real Fulgrim was still around somewhere.\n\nHang on...when?

At first Daemons can start appearing on the surface, then as the shield sinks back The Herald of Horus Angron is able to make planetfall. Magnus has slunk into the Webway and is ripping and tearing at the Emperor and his shield psychically to try and weaken it to the point where Horus himself could land on Terra. With the Emperor weakening and Malcador concerned Magnus will march an army through the Webway and into the Throne-room \"The Last Guardian\" Vulkan is sent into the Webway to confront his brother.\n\nAfter Vulkan fights his way through the Throne-room portal he takes in the ruins of the Emperor's webway projects and wonders if it could have ever worked\n\n&gt;The walls of the Imperial webway, where he\u2019d emerged after running through the portal in the Throne Room, were rigid frames on circuit-threaded Martian metal fused to various alien trans-osseous materials and cultured psychoplastics. He recognised his father\u2019s vision in this blend of human and alien technology: the distant past bolted and fused to the present, for the sake of an imperfectly understood future. It grieved him, to know it had all failed so utterly. Horus had much to answer for. As did Magnus. \n\n&gt;Vulkan was a smith, a shaper, a maker. He knew the craft of creation. How to bring artistry to bear along seams of inspiration. Working with the materials, not against them. Creating through a process, a weave of exploration and imagination. Yet the amalgamation around him rang wrong to his senses. This was something jury-rigged, erected against the grain, woven outside the seams using half-wrong approximations of the right materials. \n\n&gt;It worked, but it worked poorly. There had been an end goal in mind, but only the most ragged ability to reach it. Vulkan didn\u2019t doubt his father\u2019s ambition or the worthiness of the Emperor\u2019s ultimate goal, but the craftsman in him felt ill at ease with the improvised genius of the webway\u2019s Imperial portions. Human ingenuity was stark and flawed, almost tumorous, in this dimension. It made for an ugly union. \n\n&gt;Without the Emperor\u2019s endless maintenance, without the constant flow of the Emperor\u2019s psychic will, the Mechanicus\u2019 sections were already crumbling, rotting, falling away into the abyss where metaphysics went to die. Even without the damage from Magnus\u2019 treachery\u2026 It is all so forced, so rushed. It hurt him to admit, but that was the impression it imprinted upon his artisan\u2019s heart. Necessity had surely played its part, but the result was undeniable. \n\n&gt;Vulkan ran his hand along the walls of Martian iron and inlaid suppressive circuitry. It penetrated his gauntlets, sending a weak tingle through his fingertips. I do not know if this would ever have worked. Not for long. Perhaps not even for long enough. Imperfect. That was the word. Imperfect, when nothing less than perfection would suffice. And what if his father had come to him? Would he have been able to turn his mastery to this realm behind reality? Would his brother Ferrus have been able to help him? Would Magnus have joined them, forming a triumvirate of visionaries devoted to constructing the bridge to mankind\u2019s destiny? \n\n&gt;No. There was nothing he could\u2019ve done here \u2013 of that, he was certain. \n\n&gt;It wasn\u2019t long before Vulkan left the Imperial portions behind.

{"post": {"title": "The Emperor is not a Demon Prince...", "subreddit": "40kLore", "selftext": "Nor some kind of a Champion or Greater Demon of Chaos Undivided. He *might* \\- and I can't stress enough that this is not yet a fact - have the potential to become a Chaos God depending on what *The End and the Death* Part 2 and 3 have to say, but the power he currently displays is not Chaos-coded, so to speak.\n\nThere are a number of people who hear that the Emperor somehow took power from the Chaos Gods on Molech and look at the iconic opening blurb and come to the conclusion that the Emperor must somehow be corrupted by Chaos, something that flies in the face of a lot of lore about what tends to happen when a demon gets in close contact with anything that has the Emperor's power coursing through it. I think people fail to recognize that the Emperor is meant to be truly exceptional - in the sense that the common truths of the setting we take for granted don't always apply to him.\n\nWhile there are tons of stories that show such a thing, here are three excerpts that I feel get to the heart of the matter. First, from *Master of Mankind*, a quote regarding the reactions of demons when the Emperor steps onto the battlefield.\n\n&gt;And in a sunless realm, the sun rose at last.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The light of dawn was palpable on Ra\u2019s armour as well as his skin. It was a pressure, a presence with searing physicality. The enemy hordes felt it as acid on their skin. The creatures\u2014daemons no matter what secular truths held strong\u2014lost what little order they had ever possessed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***The Anathema!*** Ra heard their frantic agony as a sick scraping on the edges of his mind. ***The Anathema comes! The sun rises!***\n\n...\n\n&gt;Of the Neverborn, some broke ranks and fled. These cowardly shards of their vile masters knew that destruction had come. Some tore into each other, cannibalising their kindred for strength in the face of destruction. Some lost what little grasp they had on corporeality, their forms melting and dissolving before the sword-wielding monarch even reached the front lines.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The strongest raged at the sin of His existence. With a gestalt bellow loud enough to shake the windless air of this alternate reality, they fought to reach their archenemy.\n\nAs you can see, the demons react to the presence of the Emperor with a mixture of abject terror and pure loathing. This is definitely not the reaction you'd expect if they were looking at an ally or unwitting pawn. And this is back in 30k, when the Emperor was still *the Emperor* and not the *God*\\-Emperor. In fact, let's take a look at an example from 40k, from *Plague Wars*.\n\n&gt;**\u2018My humours are well balanced. I am not a scion of the Blood God to see rage everywhere, or of the infinitely cursed changer who anticipates schemes and plots, and writhes with dissatisfaction. I see what there is.

The sword he bears\u2026\u2019** Ku\u2019gath shuddered.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\u2018Are you afraid of him, third favoured of Nurgle?\u2019**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\u2018I am,\u2019** said Ku\u2019gath, deciding the course of honesty was best. **\u2018The sword he bears burns with the wounding fires of the Anathema. The death it carries allows no rebirth, only an end. The sword is the creation of the being I will not name. It is a weapon that could kill me. It could kill you.\u2019**\n\nOnce again, we see demons - in this case, Ku'gath, probably the most iconic Great Unclean One - reacting with fear when talking about the Emperor and his sword. And to really drive home that the Emperor's power before and after the heresy has little to do with him potentially being the Dark King, here is an excerpt from *the End and the Death Part 1* regarding how Chaos feels about the birth of the Dark King.\n\n&gt;*The Emperor Must Die. The Emperor Must Die.* It is written on the tattered walls, and gouged into stricken ramparts. It is written in paint and tar, pitch and ash. It is written in blood. It is written everywhere, daubed up, marked by hand, cut with blades or scorched by burners.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In some places the words have simply appeared, formed by no living hand at all. The words have risen from stone, like blisters, like urticaria, like scarification. *The Emperor Must Die. The Emperor Must Die.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is a chant too, bellowed by a million voices. It fills the air, and it covers the walls.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Around that slogan, where it is marked, other words are written: threats, menaces, the iconography of the burgeoning darkness, the malign symbols of etheric power. Four words. The four names from which there are eight. The false gods.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And one other name, too. With increasing repetition.\n\n\u2026\n\n&gt;Somewhere, in the outer darkness, four voices start to laugh. It is cruel laughter. They laugh, and begin to whisper the name of the one who is now here.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They lisp and hiss the name.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Over and over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The name.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The name of the Dark King.\n\nChaos is so excited for the Dark King that it's literally shouting its name on the streets (while also calling for the death of the Emperor). This is in stark contrast to Ku'Gath, who refuses to say the Emperor's name in a private conversation with Mortarion - only referring to him as \"Anathema\". This reinforces the fact that Chaos absolutely does not like the Emperor and he in turn was never corrupted by Chaos, is not a secret Chaos God, was not working with Chaos, or anything else like that.\n\nThat's all I wanted to say.", "ups": 53, "permalink": "/r/40kLore/comments/16s1npt/the_emperor_is_not_a_demon_prince/", "num_comments": 41}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I know the exact post that prompted this", "ups": 26, "depth": 0, "author": "nateyourdate", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "The Emperor, beloved by all, is a man.

Daemons unmade in this way will eventually reform, though it takes time and likely also an extertion of will from their patron gods. This is the type I believe we see from Magnus in the excerpt you shared.\n\nThe third kind of daemon death is the true death. Not just banishment or even dissolution, but erasure. Daemons slain by the true death are wholly deleted from the setting. No warp stuff to eventually reconstitute - they are gone. As far as I've seen, only two beings wield the power to bring the true death, and they are the Emperor, and Guilliman wielding the sword of the Emperor.\n\nIt seems like you draw no distinction between the 2nd and 3rd types of death for daemons, which is causing you to draw parallels between the power wielded by the Emperor over them and that of Magnus. \n\nAs for Khorne, I see that as akin to the 2nd form I describe above, sans the extertion of will that would allow them to reform. The passage you cite may be functionally similar to the true death, but is still of a different nature. In your excerpt, Khorne is obliterating daemons of his own making. We know that khornate daemons are an extension of his will and power, so his ability to \"obliterate\" them, rather than being the same as the Emperor's 'true death,' can be explained more as a revocation of his will to allow them to persist as extensions of himself.", "ups": 5, "depth": 3, "author": "sosomething", "replies": [{"selftext": "Where exactly in the lore is your distinction drawn?

Coupled with this, they knew of those dangers themselves.The Imperium has relied on Navigators to sail the stars and astropaths to communicate between worlds since the empire\u2019s very first breath. The Imperium itself is only possible because of those enduring souls. No void sailor or psychically touched soul can help but know of the warp\u2019s insidious predation.

She knows the sky is grey because she has been told it is so, yet she has never seen it. What, then, is grey? Is it the shade I see, or the hue seen by another man\u2019s eyes?

In Nietzsche\u2019s Apollonian and Dionysian juxtaposition, Dionysian figure is someone who is very Passionate, irational, instinctual and Chaotic. It also refers to State of intoxication, Wholeness of existence, Celebration of nature, Brute realism &amp; absurdity.\n\nQuite fitting for Russ, no?\n\nOn the other hand Valdor was given the Apollonian spear.

So to some extent, there is relevance. (Fun fact, Egyptian equivalent of Apollo is Horus\u2026 a bit of unintended irony there). \n\nLastly, Dionysian spear\u2019s hidden name is \u201cGungir\u201d.

The point is that the Emperor and the Priest-King were exactly the same kind of person, and they did exactly the same things for exactly the same reasons. The Emperor happened to be stronger, and his rule lasted slightly longer.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Priest-King of Maulland Sen,\n\nThat's got a familiar cadence to it, huh?

It gives you great insights into why the emperor thinks and act how he does.  The passage where he explains to RA why religion is so corrupting and explains the backstory of Maulland Sen and how he went from a good person who gave water and food to those in need and prayed to his god for help and blessings and one day his \u201cgod\u201d answered.  Is brilliant.  Excerpt below: \n\n\nTell me, Ra,\u2019 said the Emperor. He aimed His blade at the kneeling warlord. \u2018Tell me what you see.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Priest-King of Maulland Sen,\u2019 Ra said. \u2018In the moments before you executed him.\u2019\n\t\t\t\nThat is a title and a moment in time. What do you see?\u2019\n\nA man. A man kneeling on the snow.\u2019\n\nThat is better,\u2019 the Emperor agreed. \n\nI met him long before he was the priest-king,\u2019 the Emperor said. \u2018He began as a \u201choly man, a mendicant preacher wandering the northern wastes, gathering untainted food and purified water, giving it freely to those in need. He claimed it was his calling, and that his god lived in his kindness. It was a calling, of course. A call that was answered by the beings of the immaterium. They gave him the power to feed his beleaguered tribe and heal their ills, and his clan grew. When savage winters ate away at the other tribes, his clan sheltered beneath the protection of his power. He kept them fed, protected and unseen from the eyes of their hunting foes. Soon, hundreds of men and women were huddling for warmth within his mercy, and offered their thanks to the god that he believed he served.\n\t\t\t\nYet each miracle took more effort, Ra. More sacrifice. The end always justified the means. First the conundrums were moral in nature. What does it matter if another clan starves, if it allows his tribe to survive? Soon enough the rituals grew more occult in order to achieve their ends. What is the murder of a rival, if that death guarantees another ten years of peace? What is the life of a child? If its bloody, beating heart will ensure a monarch\u2019s immortality? Do you see?\u2019\n\nThe warp rarely makes itself known in manifest form. The damnation flooding the webway is the crescendo of its siren song. Its immensity and physicality is what makes the threat so unprecedented. Far more often, the warp seethes behind the veil, it curdles thoughts inside a skull, it inks the blood in men and women\u2019s veins. And that is enough. More than enough. It brings us to moments like these, in the company of ambitious, faithful men, too proud to see their own deception.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of this man\u2019s clan,\u2019 continued the Emperor. \u2018As a holy man he had begun with offers of food and the promise of sur \u201csurvival. Sensing his susceptibility, the warp darkened around the candle flame of his life\u2019s light. He prayed, and the warp answered.\nSoon his people were too numerous to hide. Other tribes came for his clan\u2019s riches. This man, this revered holy lord, led his people to the machines of the Old Ages, cloning and replicating and gene-forging flawed warriors to wage war for territory.\nThe clan branded their own flesh and ran to war alongside these genetic brutes, crying up to the sky for the same power their overlord enjoyed. And how far they had fallen. Committing any act in the belief of their own righteousness. All from superstition. All from ignorance.\n\nAll because one charismatic man believed that the powers that heeded his calls could be trusted. By the time he realised they could not, he believed himself powerful enough to control them, independent enough to resist them. What harm in one more gift, if it allowed his clan to thrive? What harm in one more sacrifice, if it ensured a strong harvest or victory in a coming war? And when it came time to \u201cdie, what would this powerful, independent man do? Would he go silently into the ground? Would he slumber upon a funeral pyre? Or would he \u2013 for the good of his people \u2013 reach for longer life at any cost?   \u201cAnd yet, his life is the path of faith in microcosm. Once a wandering preacher feeding the weak and the lost, ending as a blood-soaked monarch overseeing pogroms and genocides \u2013 his teeth stained by cannibal ritual, his skull a shell for the toying touch of warp-entities he does not realise he serves. Every act of violence or pain that he performs is a prayer to those entities, fuelling them, making them stronger behind the veil. What he believes no longer matters, when everything he does feeds their influence.\n\t\t\t\nThis is why we strip the comfort of religion from humanity. These are the slivers of vulnerability that faith cracks open in the human heart. Even if a belief in a lie leads us to do good, eventually it leads to the truth \u2013 that we are a species alone in the dark, threatened by the laughing games of those they \u201ccall gods.\u2019\nRa wiped his snow-flecked face with a gauntleted palm. His breathing was calm. His heart was slow. Yet his fingers trembled.\nAre they gods?\u2019\n\nWhat is a god?\u2019 the Emperor replied at once, though without challenge. He sounded curious, not defiant.\n\nI don\u2019t know, sire.\u2019\n\nA being of great power, perhaps. Am I then a god?\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course not.\u2019\n\n\u2018Is a god the focus of prayer and ritual, then? You are named in a god\u2019s honour. Ra \u2013 a god of the sun. How many cultures have worshipped the sun or given its arcing journey into the responsibility of a godling\u2019s care? More than even I can count. More than even I have seen. Each sun god or goddess bore a different name, and was revered by different people. The sun rose and fell, as it always has. Did it do so because of their prayers and offerings?\u2019\nAgainst all odds, Ra gave a mirthless, unpleasant smile. \u2018No, my king.\u2019   \n\n\u201cThe Emperor seemed suddenly weary. He shook His head, a rare moment of human expression. \u2018Beings of varying sentience and influence exist, given different names by different cultures and species. Gods. Aliens. Entities. It matters not.\u2019\n\t\t\t\nI don\u2019t think I want to know these things, sire.\u2019\n\t\t\t\nYour wishes are irrelevant, Ra.

Worse was the familiarity of its features, and the affection in its gaze. Khayon, it sent to me, smiling through the faecal murk. I backed away, weapons held in tightening fists. \u2018What is it?\u2019 Nefertari asked. She was the only one not gripped by disgust or dread. To her, this was yet another stupid game played by mon-keigh blood magicians. \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 \u2018Lorgar.\u2019 I aimed Saern at the half-melted infant in the dirty life pod. \u2018That is Lorgar.\u2019\n\nThe Horus was better, because the EC had access to his body, but only on physical side. He was weaker, confused, and lost of memories - he remembered Abaddon only when he delivers the killing blow. Fulgrim is a very succesfull one, sure, but the author said that he is a mere instrument for Fabius personal growth not intended to use further in the story, and book heavily implies that Slaanesh had a hand in the success of a project, and its not like any chaos god would do that to pre-heresy Angron, especially if it meant remaking him for the better.

A mangle of structures, ice and rubble made up the majority of the rest, but one component stood apart from this; a spacecraft of a kind totally unfamiliar to the Space Marines. The greater part of the spaceship was buried in the mass of debris, but the side of it presented to them was undamaged by time or the shifting crush of the agglomeration. His sensorium could not penetrate its gleaming hull, but Galt estimated it to be around three hundred metres long, small by Imperial standards. It was clean of line and unembellished, which made the craft appear strange to Galt\u2019s eyes. No Mechanicus runes marked its outer surface, nor were there any statues or artistic flourishes of any kind, yet in its functionality there was a clean aestheticism. It did not appear like any ship crafted by men, but Galt knew instinctively that this vessel had been built by human hands.\n\n\n&gt;Plosk began to speak rapidly in a language none understood. It was not the electronic chitter of binaric, but a true, spoken language of men. A chill went down Galt\u2019s spine as the tech-priest went on; the language was foreign to him, but amid the babble were words that sounded half-familiar, as if Plosk spoke High Gothic distorted by a dream. And then the ship replied. The Terminators stepped backwards, weapons raised. \u2018Hold!\u2019 said Nuministon. \u2018It is only a voice-activated ward, nothing more. The machine\u2019s spirit has a voice as our servitors have a voice.\u2019 The ship\u2019s voice was soft and emotionless; it too used the ancient tongue. Plosk\u2019s hands dropped. The servitors sang on. The ship responded, and the way opened. A section of the hull glowed green, forming a solid square. The light receded, so that the square became a doorway with rounded corners, delineated by a band of brightness. And then there were steps, appearing in some manner Galt could not understand. The light dimmed, lighting the new doorway and stairs in soft lambency. The ship looked as if it had always been that way, as if there had always been a door and not been a solid wall of metal only seconds before. Data flooded into their sensoriums and auspexes as the inviolable skin of the craft parted for them. \u2018Witchcraft!\u2019 gasped Mazrael, tightening his grip on his crozius. The Space Marines backed up further. Mutters of alarm came from all of them.\n\n&gt;The doorway led to a sloping corridor several metres long that joined an arterial way wide enough for four Terminators to walk abreast. The ship\u2019s interior was eerily untouched. Its artificial gravity was functional, the curved ceiling glowed softly. There was little dust, and no corrosion. The air was far purer than that aboard the Novum in Honourum, an atmospheric mix of rare quality. The design of the ship was superior in virtually every way to those on which Galt had been. Like the exterior it lacked the heavy embellishment so beloved in the Imperium. Even so, it was as beautiful in its way.

More precisely, you are looking at modifications of primitive genius.

My hypothesis was that they stirred the Twelfth to a sense of perpetual but ultimately artificial rage. Yet the opposite is true. With the alterations made to the limbic lobe and insular cortex, the surgeons have impaired the Twelfth\u2019s ability to regulate any emotion at all. Furthermore, they have rethreaded its capacity to take pleasure in anything but the sensation of anger.

The Legion\u2019s first experiments in that regard hadn\u2019t been pleasant. Kargos was one of the surgeons first trained to implant Nails in legionaries\u2019 skulls, though he\u2019d never beaten them into a psyker\u2019s brain, and wasn\u2019t responsible for the disasters that soon followed. What Kh\u00e2rn hadn\u2019t seen for himself, he\u2019d heard from his Apothecary.\n\n&gt;The first signs of unease came when implanted Librarians started causing their closest brothers to suffer blinding migraines and debilitating facial bleeds. No Librarian could stand in Angron\u2019s presence without enduring the same thing themselves; a reflection of what they inflicted on their brothers.\n\n&gt;But the depths of the flaws became truly obvious in battle. **Librarians gifted with the Nails lost the ability to control their psychic talents. One of them, a warrior attached to the 100th Company, had been lost to the Nails in his very first battle after implantation, and immolated three squads when he couldn\u2019t cease projecting witch-lightning from his eyes. Several others had just\u2026 burst. They combusted in flaming gore.**\n\n&gt;**More and more died \u2013 none right away, but they never survived for long. In a single month, almost every Librarian had been fitted with the Nails. Mere weeks later, they started dying.**\n\n&gt;Optimism, albeit cautious, had reigned for a while. After the first deaths, the psychically trained legionaries had sought to master the Nails, to balance their sixth senses with the bionics now altering their brains\u2019 chemistry. A matter of willpower, they said, and their brothers had pretended not to notice the desperation in their eyes. Yes. A matter of willpower. It made sense.\n\n&gt;**But they kept dying. They died in battle, in storms of fire or lightning, or \u2013 in several incidents \u2013 by pulsing hateful pain through the Nails of nearby warriors and forcing their own kindred to suffer cerebrovascular blockages. Entire squads died of brain haemorrhages and strokes at their Codiciers\u2019 boots.**\n\n&gt;That settled it. Angron gave his psychic sons a choice between execution and the Nails\u2019 removal. The Legion learned, in those early years after their primarch\u2019s rediscovery, that they\u2019d mutilated themselves in the image of a man without mercy. The Nails couldn\u2019t be removed; every World Eater knew it, for the Emperor\u2019s own techno-mages had failed to remove the primarch\u2019s implants. Even so, most Librarians submitted themselves for the attempt.\n\n&gt;Every one of them died, without exception. With their rewired brains misfiring and enslaved to altered impulses, none of them died easy, and none of them died well.\n\n&gt;Soon enough, the last Librarians were those who\u2019d not yet received Nails in a Legion now overcome by them. They eked out an isolated existence in the near-empty halls of their Librarius aboard the *Conqueror.*\n\n&gt;One by one they, too, began to die. Not from malfunction or misuse, but because they were World Eaters, and World Eaters lived brief, violent lives. A hundred remained. Then fifty. Then twenty.\n\n&gt;No one mourned them. In a Legion that prized the bonds of front-line brotherhood above all else, the silent brothers died alone \u2013 never forgotten, but always ignored.

{"post": {"title": "[Excerpt | Trials of Azrael] Kh\u00e2rn and Azrael's duel", "subreddit": "40kLore", "selftext": "I've seen a lot of misconceptions about the duel between Kh\u00e2rn and Azrael in Trials of Azrael, mostly because it's an audiobook only and I haven't seen a single excerpt or transcript of their confrontation anywhere online aside from the odd couple of lines. So here it is - and it's a lot more one-sided that people seem to think judging by the comments i've seen in this sub.\n\nContext: The Dark Angels and Grey Knights are on a joint operation to close the damnation cache in the Pandorax system. As Azrael prepares to teleport with his brothers, a bisected cultist is able to speak a few syllables that apparently interferes with Azrael\u2019s teleportation, placing him alone in a room with our swell guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Kh\u00e2rn leapt over the barricade of tables, Gorechild screaming in his hand. Azrael deflected the blow with his sword, dragging the chainaxe into the chamber floor, which tore open under the grinding teeth. He readied to drive the blade down across Kh\u00e2rn\u2019s neck. With Gorechild still embedded in the deck, the World Eater struck out with his fist, the punch so powerful that it lifted Azrael from the ground and sent him crashing into a table. Kh\u00e2rn roared, freeing his weapon and was on the Dark Angel in an instant. Azrael had to roll aside to prevent the chainaxe from biting into his breastplate. His bloodlust up, Kh\u00e2rn continued to slash down wildly with Gorechild, forcing the Dark Angel to remain prone to avoid the blows. Each impact shattered more of the deck, thick cracks tracing through the toughened metal. The chainaxe stuck once again, and Azrael sprung to his feet, wielding the sword two-handed. He thrust into Kh\u00e2rn, who reacted a fraction too slowly \u2013 the blade slashing across the World Eater\u2019s forearm.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Azrael hadn\u2019t drawn blood, but a deep gouge now ran through the red armour. Enraged, Kh\u00e2rn heaved Gorechild out of the bulkhead and charged the Dark Angel. Strangely, a faint purple glow emanated from where the axe had torn away the floor. Focusing on the moment, Azrael stood his ground until Kh\u00e2rn was committed to the attack, before dodging the lethal blow in a spinning motion, and catching the berserker across the back with the edge of his sword. This time, Azrael did draw blood. Kh\u00e2rn roared and repeated his charge, but it was as ineffective as the first. Azrael ducking the blow and this time scoring a hit on the traitor Astartes torso.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Supreme Grandmaster had learnt many things during his long years of combat. Not least of which, was that an angry opponent was a sloppy one. But in the case of Kh\u00e2rn the Betrayer, the opposite held true. For 10,000 years, the favoured son of the Blood God had followed the eightfold path to every corner of the Galaxy, a trail of corpses in his wake, and countless skulls claimed for the throne of Khorne. Numerous were the opponents who had thought Kh\u00e2rn beaten, but just as numerous were the bodies of those who had prematurely celebrated victory over the World Eater. The more battered and bloody he became - the greater his rage. The greater his rage - the more battered and bloody his enemies became.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Azrael had cut Kh\u00e2rn twice. It was unlikely there would be a third time. Bellowing, Kh\u00e2rn launched himself at Azrael, again, keeping Gorechild high until the very last moment. Anticipating the Dark Angel\u2019s feint, Kh\u00e2rn swung the chainaxe low, catching Azrael on the side of the knee and shearing away armour. He turned the head outwards on the upstroke, catching Azrael under the chin with the haft, before spinning the axe around again to bring it down in a killing stroke. Still gripping his blade with both hands, Azrael brought it up swiftly, turning a mortal blow into a wounding one. Deflecting off the dark metal sword, Gorechild narrowly missed decapitating Azrael \u2013 biting instead into ornate pauldron. The Supreme Grandmaster\u2019s arm went limp at his side, and he raised the sword of secrets in one hand to fend off the next blow from the blood-streaked chainaxe.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Gorechild tore yet another chunk from the floor, more diffused purple light spilling from the deck below. Relentlessly Kh\u00e2rn came at Azrael, the Dark Angel desperately parrying the savage swipes as he backed away from his assailant. For every blow that he knocked aside, another made contact, breaking open armour and tearing the flesh beneath. There was no longer opportunity for counterattack. Each motion of the Dark Angel\u2019s sword was a defensive stroke staving off the inevitable. Aiming low again, Kh\u00e2rn slipped beneath Azrael\u2019s guard, and Gorechild ate through armour, arterial blood spilling from the mutilated thigh.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Azrael dropped to one knee and heaved his sword upwards to block another potentially killing blow, which ended up embedded in the deck. Struggling to free the chainaxe from the ruined bulkhead, Kh\u00e2rn launched a fist at Azrael, connecting heavily with the Dark Angel\u2019s helmeted head. Kh\u00e2rn raised his fist again, but still struggling to free Gorechild, instead gripped the haft and tugged hard to release the trapped weapon. Kneeling, bathed in the purple light seeping through the cracks in the deck, Azrael defiantly raised the Sword of Secrets. Kh\u00e2rn\u2019s flank was exposed \u2013 the armour already cracked and coated in blood from Azrael\u2019s earlier attack. If he could drive the blade in; open the wound up further \u2013 then even the notorious Kh\u00e2rn the Betrayer could not survive that. But his death would not be instant. He would still be able to free the chainaxe, and Azrael\u2019s life would be forfeit regardless. Kh\u00e2rn was not the objective here. Aiding the Grey Knights in closing the Damnation cache and ridding the Pandorax system of Abaddon and his Black Legion was. As tempting as it was to die a hero\u2019s death and be the one to rid the Imperium of Kh\u00e2rn the Betrayer forever \u2013 Azrael took the only option left open to him. He drove his sword point down into the already cracked deck, opening it even further to release more of the unnatural light. He lifted his sword again in the same instant Gorechild finally broke free and slammed it down. This time breaking the bulkhead beneath them completely. As Kh\u00e2rn\u2019s chainaxe swung harmlessly overhead, Azrael let himself fall.\n\nI can post the prelude to this part in the comments, hope you guys enjoy.", "ups": 96, "permalink": "/r/40kLore/comments/16qz84x/excerpt_trials_of_azrael_kh\u00e2rn_and_azraels_duel/", "num_comments": 22}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Weirdly enough for a Dark Angel, Azrael showed the power of common sense and didn't die like a slab of meat.", "ups": 56, "depth": 0, "author": "real_corswain", "replies": [{"selftext": "Dark Angels... when no fallen are involved, they are pragmatic and focused warriors par excellence.", "ups": 37, "depth": 1, "author": "Kristian1805", "replies": [{"selftext": "The fallen or a world similar to Caliban is what it takes to make them turn into fuckin Death Company look alikes lol", "ups": 10, "depth": 2, "author": "real_corswain", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "It\u2019s not that weird for Azrael Himself, he kept his eye on the bigger victory over a potential fatal glorious last stand in a minor fight. \n\nHe went after the puppet master that had put him and Kharn in that position; kharn also knew that they were being manipulated into potentially killing each other, but didn\u2019t care.", "ups": 17, "depth": 1, "author": "dealingwithSuffering", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "Pretty cool exercept I haven't read before.\n\nPeople give Azrael more credit than deserved based off this fight but I'd be lying if I wasnt still impressed.

Like I said, this is a complicated hellhole of treachery, madness and deceit. As it stands, the official line is that there are three factions empowered to \u201ccreate IP\u201d (an exact quote), and that\u2019s GW, BL and FW. **Given that the 40K RPG is mostly made by folks working in or around the main three companies, I think it\u2019s fair to say that its lore counts as canon, too.**\n\nADB, source [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20111127203730/https://www.boomtron.com/2011/03/grimdark-ii-loose-canon/)\n\n&gt;Keep in mind Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 are worlds where half truths, lies, propaganda, politics, legends and myths exist. The absolute truth which is implied when you talk about \"canonical background\" will never be known because of this. Everything we know about these worlds is from the viewpoints of people in them which are as a result incomplete and even sometimes incorrect. The truth is mutable, debatable and lost as the victors write the history...  \n\n&gt;**Here's our standard line: Yes it's all official**, but remember that we're reporting back from a time where stories aren't always true, or at least 100% accurate. **if it has the 40K logo on it, it exists in the 40K universe. Or it was a legend that may well have happened. Or a rumour that may or may not have any truth behind it.**  \n\n&gt;**Let's put it another way: anything with a 40K logo on it is as official as any Codex... and at least as crammed full of rumours, distorted legends and half-truths.**  \n\n&gt;I think the real problem for me, and I speak for no other, is that the topic as a \"big question\" doesn't matter. It's all as true as everything else, and all just as false/half-remembered/sort-of-true. The answer you are seeking is \"Yes and no\" or perhaps \"Sometimes\". And for me, that's the end of it.  \n\n&gt;Now, ask us some specifics, eg can Black Templars spit acid and we can answer that one, and many others. But again note that answer may well be \"sometimes\" or \"it varies\" or \"depends\".  \n\n&gt;But is it all true? Yes and no. Even though some of it is plainly contradictory? Yes and no. Do we deliberately contradict, retell with differences? Yes we do. Is the newer the stuff the truer it is? Yes and no. In some cases is it true that the older stuff is the truest? Yes and no. Maybe and sometimes. Depends and it varies.  \n\n&gt;It's a decaying universe without GPS and galaxy-wide communication, where precious facts are clung to long after they have been changed out of all recognition. Read A Canticle for Liebowitz by Walter M Miller, about monks toiling to hold onto facts in the aftermath of a nucelar war; that nails it for me.\"\n\nMarc Gasciogne\n\n&gt;**So saying \"I prefer the codexes\" is fine/cool/accurate, but \"I think the codexes are a higher tier of canon\" isn't**. GW specifically goes against that in how it functions: it wants all of it be real, and none of it to be real. That's not an accident. It's not an excuse. It's the point of a complicated future history.\u00a0\u00a0So you're wrong there, but that's also where your point loops back around to being dead right again. GW wouldn't disagree with you: the entire point is indeed to decide for yourself. **You choose the sources you prefer**. That's baked into the whole deal. Heck, it\u00a0is\u00a0the whole deal. **But with that comes the GW mandate and intention that, no, no one official source is held in higher esteem than others, internally. You choose the sources you\u00a0prefer.\u00a0You don't choose which sources are official canon.**\n\nAaron Dembski-Bowden\n\n&gt;I think you need to look again at those texts.  \n\n&gt;Where Perturabo is primarily seen through the eyes of others (or in anachronistic historical record) he is an unreasonable tyrant with violent mood swings.  \n\n&gt;Where you see things through HIS eyes, he is a frustrated genius who nobody else seems to understand.

It feels like a weak narrative element, and to me it actually devalues the immensity of what the primarchs were; including the way they dealt with their torments or succumbed to them, and the decisions they made.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'm also not a fan of the idea that Curze's essence/soul is somehow bound into the crown (I mean... why?

I struggle to see (or to find any interest) in a plot that genuinely claims \"He who holds this crown is king\", when that's anathema to how the Chaos Legions work, and even a cursory glance at the setting reveals that. A storyline about uniting a fractured Legion would be cool (look at Abaddon for how it's done...) but \"I have this relic\" isn't the way to do it. Abaddon had the Talon of Horus - the freaking Talon of Horus, a weapon that slew a primarch - and it still wasn't enough to unite a Legion. But Night Haunter's little crown is? Um. Really? Exactly why would they rally around the guy holding the crown?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That's just not how Chaos Marines work - and despite their attitude, the Night Lords are undeniably a Chaos Legion.

They do not offer the boundless cunning and sorcerous potency of Tzeentch, nor even the hedonistic pleasures or obsessive fulfilments of Slaanesh. Nurgle's remit is plague. His boons are in themselves supernatural maladies, daemonic parasites and disfiguring mutations. Who but a nihilistic lunatic would willingly offer worship to the author of such woes?**\n\n&gt;Yet disease, decay, entropy and the despair they bring are fundamental facts for populations and armies across the galaxy. On world after world, crops fail, food spoils and sickness and starvation follow. Overcrowded field hospitals are hotbeds for swift-spreading infections and feeding grounds for rapacious parasites. Languishing in foetid slums, pinned down and wounded amidst the contaminating filth of no man's land, ravaged by noxious bioweapons and alien phages, souls beyond number confront the inescapable fact of their own mortality. Some cling to faith and hope until the last. Most pass beyond the limits of their endurance and cry out in their delirium for salvation no matter its source. Whether they suffer until the end or their will gives way, they all empower the Plague God.\n\n&gt;It is said by the worshippers of Nurgle that - for all the cruelties he heaps upon realspace -  he is at heart a fond-hearted and grandfatherly deity. There are few whose supplication he would refuse, nor deny his rancid gifts. Thus, the worshippers of Nurgle become willing hosts for all his most grotesque contagions precisely in order to survive their touch. They take into themselves that which would otherwise be their destroyer, becoming one with it, and glorying in the unholy vitality and resilience such a gruesome bargain grants. Each mortal who makes this pact becomes another vector for Nurgle's supernatural contagions, and another catalyst to furthering the Grandsire's power.\n\n&gt;In truth, succumbing to the worship of Nurgle is indeed a kind of madness. His mortal worshippers exult in all the repugnant signs of disease and mutation that should instinctively repel them. They willingly spread his plagues far and wide, even to comrades in arms or loyal friends they would previously have sought to protect. They do this in the certainty they are sharing Nurgle's priceless gifts, echoing their deity's boundless generosity. The most fervent of Nurgle's worshippers recognise that even amidst the misery of disease and the ruination of decay, new life is born.

Several legions of Necrons from the Atun Dynasty fall upon the swarming bio-horrors, their Monoliths and Annihilation Barges laying down a crippling bombardment of fire while a spearhead of Triarch Praetorians cut their way deep into the monstrous horde. Though the swarm fights back with the fury of a wounded beast, the Tyranids are caught between the attacking Necrons and the firepower of the surviving T\u2019au. As the last chitinous horrors crash down dead, the entire Necron army turns on its collective heel and departs without a word of explanation. The bewildered T\u2019au can do little but give thanks for their mysterious rescue, little knowing they have just witnessed the servants of the Silent King.\n\n*Codex Necrons 8ed* p31\n\nDrukhari and T'au vs Tyranids\n\n&gt;**The War of Dark Revelations**\n\n&gt;T\u2019au forces defending Vigos against the onrushing might of Hive Fleet Kraken make the fatal decision to ally themselves with Urien Rakarth.

They finally\u00a0resolve to strike back when he transforms T\u2019au warriors into monstrous Grotesques, and begins demanding a tribute of their sacred Ethereals. The T\u2019au muster their reserves from the world of Rubikon, yetwhen their blow falls they find Rakarth\u2019s fleet already gone, having left only\u00a0holograms and sensor-ghosts in its wake. Panicked distress calls begin to issue from the defenceless Rubikon mere hours later. These gabbled reports tell of twisted, pale-fleshed invaders calling themselves the Prophets of Flesh.

Three Little Lords cling one-handed to his\npauldrons, swinging happily as the Kardainn-master swaggers.\n\n&gt;For the most part, Garstag moves slowly, but when he has to, when the old\nrages are stoked again, he can still generate frightening momentum. His\nchainsword swings, batting aside falling rock, and he barges through the rest\nof it, shouldering aside tottering pillars and wheeling around to find a target.\n\n\n&gt;The rest of the Kardainn come behind him, cutting and blasting.\nThey are all in their bloated and swollen Terminator plate,\ntrue giants of slaughter.\n\n&gt;Some is Tartaros pattern, some Cataphractii, some of\nmore obscure provenance or no longer clearly identifiable. \nThey carry flails,\nmauls and combi-bolters, clattering heavily down the crowded passages with\ncondensation steaming from their vox-grilles.\n\n&gt;Garstag is running before the rest of them, his huge body hurtling into the flying debris.\n\n&gt;It was a brave decision to board Solace. The enemy must have been\nexpecting reinforcements at some stage, for even Imperial Space Marines\nwould not be bone-headed enough to take on a fully loaded grand cruiser in\nscattered squads. The Lords of Silence are a powerful warband, numbering\nmore than six hundred Unbroken and several thousand Unchanged, ably\nprepared to defend a ship that is more than partly alive and which harbours a\nvindictive streak towards its old makers. Solace was prepared not for mere\nraiding, but for invasion. It is equipped for decades of continuous warfare, a\nship-borne army in its own right.\n\n&gt;So they must have been expecting reinforcements. What happened to\nprevent it?\n\n&gt;Garstag does not have time to reflect on that. He pushes himself into a\ncombat stance, shoving aside the shattered remnants of a bulkhead hatch. \n\n &gt;This chamber is where the enemy has decided to make their stand \u2013\ntwenty of them, he thinks,\nisolated and cut off and determined to die with honour.\n\n&gt; The Kardainn-master is brutally huge within\nthat confined space, hunched like a coiled dragon in a cave, puffing out\ncondensation from his many helm vents. His warriors stomping into a hurricane of dust and organics.\n\n&gt;The Tactical Marines of the Iron Shades Chapter are knee-deep in filth and broken metal, locked in darkness and\nonly visible from muzzle-flashes and the dark green glow of their helm\nlenses.\n\n&gt;He does not cry out as he cuts into them. They are shouting liberally as they\nfight back, spewing invective and battle-chants. This seems to animate\nthem \u2013 to give their blows added heft. They are skilled and committed,\nmoving fast even in the tight confines and plentiful wreckage. Garstag sees a\nSpace Marine vault across a collapsed beam and empty his bolter into the\noncoming charge of Brannad, one of the Kardainn, which slows his advance\nsignificantly.\n\n&gt;But they are fighting a losing battle. The very environment is raised against\nthem \u2013 glowing tentacles burst from the foaming water, grasping at their legs\nand arms. There are Little Lords in the rafters, and they throw themselves at\nthe warriors with snickering abandon, chewing down on power cables and\narmour joints. Every time a fighter has to shake one off, it gives time for\nGarstag\u2019s brothers to close in and finish the task.\n\n&gt;Terminator plate gives them a huge advantage, and this is no standard\nTactical Dreadnought armour \u2013 like everything else, it has been changed,\nexpanded, thickened and mutated. Brannad has a curl of sucker-encrusted\nhooks for a right arm, writhing like a nest of serpents. Artarion has a fanged\nmouth snapping over the barrel of his heavy bolter, which is linked to his\nbody by permanent strands of glistening mucus. \n\n &gt;To wear the\nKardainn\u2019s colours is to make an irrevocable choice. You do not step back\nfrom it again, for that armour will swallow you, mould you, and then\nconsume you. \n\n&gt;Garstag himself has the\ngreatest of the Gifts \u2013 a chainsword of living talons, crackling with corposant\nand dripping with ever-renewing toxins.\n\n&gt;Garstag does not attempt to emulate the swift strikes of the enemy. He trusts\nin his colossal ability to absorb punishment and strides through the murk in\nstately measure, taking hits from bolt-rounds and barely flinching. The\nKardainn are fighting as the Death Guard have always fought, like a gauntlet\nclosing on a throat, slowly, building pressure, building and building until\nresistance snaps.\n\n&gt;An Iron Shade leaps out at him from the darkness, sable armour glinting,\nsweeping a power blade close, two-handed. He\u2019s far faster than Garstag, and\nthe crackling edge sinks into his leading shoulderguard. Living ceramite\ncloses over the wound instantly, sucking the sword from the Space Marine\u2019s\ngrasp. He reaches for his bolt pistol, but Garstag can grab him now, seizing\nhim by the throat with his claw. For a second the Iron Shade fights back,\nthrashing out as his boots leave the deck, but then Garstag squeezes \u2013 a\nsavage contraction of servos and fused sinew \u2013 and his attacker\u2019s neck is\nbroken. Garstag throws the limp body aside and it crashes into the bloodfoamed filth.\n\n&gt;The rest of the Corpse-spawn are beaten back now. They are falling away,\nharried on every side, pursued down the corridor by the Kardainn, dogged by\nswarms of Little Lords, struck by falling spars and foaming gouts of\ncorrosive liquid.

Imagine a scenario where the GPU can render 300fps at 1080p, but the CPU can only push 60fps. In this scenario, MIN(60,300) = 60, sou you'll end up with 60fps.\n\nIncreasing the resolution to 4K will quadruple the amount of pixels the GPU has to render every frame, so the amount of frames that the GPU is able to push will drop by factor of 4, 300/4 = 75.

I have this very frustrating issue and I am at a loss as it occurs at very random moments, and I have nothing to hang onto to troubleshoot this ;/\n\nThere's no specific moment or scenario that triggers this, or at least I haven\u2019t found it yet. So I played a few games in the past like Overwatch 2 and Dota 2 and while playing, the whole PC just randomly froze\u2026 The game sounds stopped, the only thing I could hear was my friends talking on Discord, but they could no longer hear me. (External MIC stopped working apparently) The PC was completely unresponsive, the mouse did not move, and when pressing numlock/capslock, the LEDs on the keyboard did not change. ALT-TAB and CTRL-ALT-DEL shortcuts do not work; I turned off the monitor with the button on it and turned it back on, and the monitor said it no longer detects an input. The only thing left was to hard reset my PC. Classic HARDLOCK...\n\nNo Blackscreens, no BSOD nothing, it just sits there with the last frame on the screen. I onetime left it like that for 30mins, but it did not change anything, it did not come back to life \ud83d\ude41\n\nI would suspect some GPU under stress issues, but in some moments I was barely doing anything GPU intensive, like waiting in the menu or something. And this one time, the PC just froze on me while I was on YouTube and no game was running in the background \ud83e\udd14\n\nI ran with default RAM speeds by disabling XMP, still freezes, did memtest86 multiple times, and everything is all right there. BIOS is at the latest version. AMD drivers are up to date. DDU was done as well. GPU is not overclocked or undervolted. Enhanced sync turned off in Adrenaline;\n\nThe only thing I might be able to pinpoint, is that maybe Freesync causes issues like that? This issue has been occurring for more than a year now.

But once the GPU encroaches on 16GB/s, or starts maxing out VRAM, the limitations of 3.0 become evident in poor quality frame rates.\n\nPowerColor did field testing two years ago, and determined 83% of all stuttering and artifacts were throughput interference.\n\nTake for instance your 5900X.

The goal, is to keep that from happening as much as possible.\n\nAnd actually, up until AM5, Ryzen IMCs were far superior, and had been since around 2011, then intels. It's been 16-point (8-point per channel) to Intel's 4-point. AM5 took a direct hit, as running four sticks/all eight channels, reduces the front bus speed by as much as 40%.

{"post": {"title": "Low FPS and heavy stuttering | 5600X + 7900XTX", "subreddit": "AMDHelp", "selftext": "Summary of issue: Heavy stutter and low-fps on Dota 2, Baldurs Gate3, and Snowrunner.Since the issue seems to be present across various games - I'll focus on Dota as benchmarks - but testing on other games still proves the same.\n\nUsing Vulkan is unbearable - very heavy stutter - low fps (sub 80fps). DirectX is better but still getting around 90-110fps with occasional stutter.\n\n**What I have tried:**\n\n\\- I've verified the games and reinstalled them\n\n\\- Cleaned up drivers using AMD Cleanup util and tried Driver only and Full installs\n\n\\- Updated BIOS revision\n\n\\- My RAM is a bit slow - borrowed higher clocked RAM (2x8GB) @ 3200Mhz to test - nothing changed.\n\n\\- Disabled CPU virtualization and hyperthreading - seems to smooth out the game in terms of stuttering, but FPS remains the same.\n\n\\- Reinstalled a clean copy of Windows on a spare SSD and tried a fresh install of just AMD drivers, Steam - issue remains.\n\n\\- Tried overclocking and unlocking power limits on GPU - no difference.\n\n\\- Switched off my primary monitor to the secondary only to isolate - no change in fps even though my secondary monitor is 2560x1440 - which is half the resolution of my primary one.- Installed Manjaro with the gpu drivers (tried both open source and proprietary) to test the Linux version of Dota to exclude a Windows issue - same result capped around 120fps - however it's Vulkan only.\n\n**Personal observations:**\n\n\\- CPU load seems to follow a pattern of up and down\n\n\\- I've got a liquid cooling loop from EKWB - haven't experienced any throttling issues - temps seem to be sitting around 80c on Tctl when gaming.\n\n\\- Ran FireMark, Heaven Bench and GeekBench - results seem to be in the right ballpark (differences are 5-10% from the mean)\n\n\\- Both CPU and GPU usage when playing Dota seem to be low - GPU around 60% - CPU jumps around between 40-70%\n\nAt this point I am all exhausted of options - I have no idea whether it's a driver issue - or the games just have issues with my hardware combo.\n\nAny tips are appreciated.\n\n**System Specifications:**\n\nOperating System: Windows 11 22H2, OS Build 22621.2283\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5600X, all stock settings\n\nGPU: AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX with Adrenalin 23.9.1\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte Aorus ELITE X570 with latest Bios F38F\n\nRAM: 32GB (4x16) Corsair CMK32GX4M2A2666C16 Vengeance LPX 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4 2666 (running with XMP profile)\n\nStorage: 1TB WDC WDS100T2B0C NVME\n\nPSU: Corsair RMe Series RM850e 850W 80 PLUS Gold\n\nDisplays:(Primary) AOC AGON AG493UCX 49\" on DP\n\n(Secondary) Acer XB270HU on Display Port", "ups": 3, "permalink": "/r/AMDHelp/comments/16pnjfy/low_fps_and_heavy_stuttering_5600x_7900xtx/", "num_comments": 14}, "replies": [{"selftext": "You\u2019re cpu bottlenecked with an uncapped fps.

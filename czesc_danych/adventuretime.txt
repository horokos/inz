{"post": {"title": "A reminder of our spoiler policy for Fionna and Cake!", "subreddit": "adventuretime", "selftext": "Hi fellow ATimers! With less than a week to go until the *Fionna and Cake* series premieres, and since it's been a loooooong time since this has really been an issue (HOW many years has it been since we've had weekly episode releases?!?), now seemed the right time to remind everyone about the sub's spoiler policy!\n\nQuick reminder to start off with: Fionna and Cake episodes will be released weekly on the Max streaming service (formerly known as HBO Max) in the USA (at 12 am [midnight] PST/3 am EST - [see what time this is in your timezone!](https://dateful.com/convert/pdt-pacific-daylight-time?t=0am)). Two episodes will be released every week, starting on 31 August and finishing on 28 September, for a total of ten episodes. The eps will be 22 minutes long each.  \n\n##Spoiler tags\n\nWhen the show begins airing, we will require spoiler tags on **ALL POSTS RELATING TO THE NEW EPISODES** for up to a week after each episode is released. (For example, discussion regarding episodes 1 and 2 will need to be spoiler tagged from 31 August until 07 September) If you're concerned about spoilers, a week should be enough time to watch the episode.\n\nPlease avoid putting spoilers in the TITLE of your thread. A spoiler tag is useless if you've already spilled the beans in the title. If your spoiler pertains to something only shown at SDCC or revealed in a review, etc, please make that clear in the title so people can easily skip it if they'd rather not be spoiled on such things.  \n\nSpoiler text can be done like this: `&gt;!SPOILERS GO HERE!&lt;`.\n\n##Spoiler tags for trailers\n\nAfter discussion, we've decided that **anything from a trailer that has been officially and widely released DOES NOT require a spoiler tag/flair**, though you are of course welcome to still tag it. We're operating under the reasonable assumption that if it's in a trailer, it's something the crew want us to see and discuss/speculate on/etc. If you'd like to avoid seeing ANYTHING from the show before it begins airing, your best option is to unsubscribe and/or avoid the sub until you've watched it.  \n\nOur definition of \"widely released\" is that it's been officially uploaded to the internet - so **anything that's ONLY been shown at SDCC currently** ***DOES NEED A SPOILER TAG***, so that those avoiding SDCC spoilers can avoid them. It's also best if you preface any SDCC spoilers with a warning, so people that want to avoid them can do so.\n\nGood: Human Starchy is so cute!   \nAlso good: &gt;!Do you guys think the green haired person on the bus is Fern??!!&lt;   \n\nBad: I was at SDCC and they showed a clip that revealed that Rosebud was his sled! OMG!    \nGood: (Spoilers for stuff that was shown at SDCC) &gt;!Snape killed Dumbledore!!&lt;   \n\nIn the (hopefully unlikely) event that any official sources release a clip, screenshot, etc etc that clearly should *not* have been released yet (as has unfortunately happened with CN shows in the past), please do mark those with spoiler tags, etc. Hopefully this won't be an issue, but you never know with CN.   \n(It should go without saying, but leaks or filmed footage from SDCC... basically anything illegal... should not be posted on here *at all*, we'll remove any posts like that.)   \n\n##Spoiler tags for reviews\n\nPlease spoiler tag and clearly mark ALL discussion for reviews of the show released prior to the show's premiere).   \n\n##But I live outside the US and...\n\nAs a reminder, we don't allow links or discussion on how to pirate the show on this sub. Sorry, but it could get us into big trouble (besides, the more attention these sites get, the more likely it is they'll get taken down, and you wouldn't want that, would you? :p). If you want to keep up with the sub as the show airs in the US, you could try using a VPN to watch it on Max's US feed, otherwise you'll have to either figure out a way to watch it yourself or just avoid the sub until it airs in your country. There are plenty of sites to help you watch cartoons online for free these days, though; a quick Google should help you find what you're looking for.   \n\n##I'm not sure if my topic counts as a spoiler or not. (NEW)\n\n(Section added 14/09) As more episodes of F&amp;C air and more and more previous eps are being referenced, the lines on what is and isn't a spoiler have started to blur. I.e. a revelation in a new episode putting something from the original series or Distant Lands into a new light. \n\nWhile spoilers for anything released prior to Fionna and Cake don't need to be tagged *in general*, if the episode being discussed is relevant to a F&amp;C ep, it's probably a good idea to err on the side of caution and add a spoiler tag just in case. A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself: could this question lead to spoilery comments regarding the latest ep? If so, tag it.   \n\n(I.e. if you feel like talking about a random season 1 ep just because, that probably doesn't require a spoiler tag. If you feel like discussing an old episode because something in F&amp;C brought it to mind again, it should probably be tagged.)\n\nIn general, it's always better to play it safe and add a spoiler tag rather than post without. It's no big deal if you tag something that doesn't necessarily *need* to be spoiler-tagged; better that than run the risk of ruining the eps for people before they've had a chance to watch the new eps.", "ups": 102, "permalink": "/r/adventuretime/comments/160jwd5/a_reminder_of_our_spoiler_policy_for_fionna_and/", "num_comments": 41}, "replies": [{"selftext": "[Trailer 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/154z8ff/fionna_cake_premieres_august_31_trailer/)   \n[Trailer 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/15ttbtu/adventure_time_fionna_cake_official_trailer/)   \n\n(Linking these since I had to unsticky the first thread to sticky *this* one - I really, REALLY wish we could have three stickies - and I figure it'd be helpful to have them all in one place)   \n\nfor Old Reddit users, you should see a link to this thread on the submission page when posting a new link/thread now (or you will in a few mins when I put that up, anyway).

{"post": {"title": "Hopes and Predictions for the Last Episodes", "subreddit": "adventuretime", "selftext": "To really hammer home that Simon already has people in his life who care about him, something I'd like to see in these final episodes is Marceline going to visit Simon in the human city, and finding him gone. I'd like for Marceline to walk into his house, discover Simon's shrine to Golb and the dead Choose Goose, and realize that something bad has probably happened. It would also raise suspicions if Simon's house/exhibit is closed up for several days. So it would all logically follow.  \n\nThen it would be awesome if Marceline teamed up with PB and Finn to retrace Simon's steps. They could talk to the little girl, Astrid. They could interview everyone at the forest market who saw Fionna and Cake, and saw them get teleported away by Prismo. Since Finn and Jake visited Prismo a lot, Finn would have reason to suspect this. And PB could probably figure out a way to reach the Time Room. \n\nI think this would be a neat way for our main cast to move the plot along one more time and reenter the narrative, by trying to figure out what the hell happened to Simon. And come to think of it, have Marcy and PB ever interacted with Prismo? \n\nAll of that would take care of an episode's A-Plot. Meanwhile, the B-Plot would involve Simon finally interacting with Betty/Golb, and there are only a few ways I can see this playing out. A while back, I sort of headcanoned that the hybrid of Betty and Golb is fundamentally unstable, and that all traces of Betty would be eventually destroyed, returning Golb to his original state. \n\nGolb is an entity of pure chaos, and the introduction of Betty's mind would have made chaos itself a little less chaotic. It's like oil and water, it can't coexist forever. I can't imagine being merged with Golb would be pleasant-- it would be more like hell. In any case, I think Simon is going to find that there's not very much left of the original Betty, and what little remains is tortured and broken. Simon will have to finally let her go. \n\nBut we've all known this had to happen. We all knew from the get-go that Simon would have to somehow move on from Betty by the end. That was almost a given. So how will the show twist the knife? Tom Kenny and the showrunners have ALL basically said, prepare to be emotionally destroyed. \n\nOne possibility is, Simon has a drawn-out face to face conversation with a projection of Betty inside Golb, where he has to make a choice between either leaving her technically alive, but in a state of everlasting torment, or using the crown's power to separate Betty and Golb, which would kill her. That sounds like it's around the right level of anguish.  \n\nI'm also feeling a heroic sacrifice coming, maybe from Fionna, after she sees her world start to rip apart under the external influence of something happening to Simon. Especially if other characters join the party and are subsequently put in danger. I'd absolutely love for Fionna and Cake to interact with our original versions of Marceline, PB, and Finn. Just once, in an \"all hope seems lost\" type of moment. How easy is it to imagine Fionna saying something like, \"I'm not even supposed to exist, let me do this,\" in the face of a terrifying threat? Girl needs some self-esteem juice, and I don't mean booze. \n\nAs for Scarab, I expect they'll either get a tiny bit redeemed, or they'll be destroyed with comical swiftness. So far he's been kind of an uninteresting antagonist, but if he sees something that makes him change his tune about Fionna and Cake, that would be mmmmmACCEPTABLE. \n\nHowever the climax goes, the show has set up so many potential scenes to showcase catharsis and development for Simon at the end.

But one the things that was obvious to everyone was that the their relationship was mostly one sided, with Betty dropping her dream for Simon's and the latter being obvious to it. Looking back there are multiple examples of this being a theme for Simon. We see in Simon and Marcy that he consistently puts on the Crown despite Marcy's objections and leaves her despite her wanting him to stay. Currently he wants to get the crown back and become Ice King, but doesn't realize that will undoubtedly hurt Marceline and waste Betty's efforts. He's not a bad man for this as from his perspectives everyone liked him better when he was a cool wizard dude. But it does make his interactions and relationship with people feel more real and consistent and I admire the writers for taking this route.", "ups": 113, "permalink": "/r/adventuretime/comments/16qemwx/simon_is_a_selfish_hero_and_thats_kind_of_okay/", "num_comments": 12}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Man, episodes 7 and 8 have really turned some opinions against Simon, and it's pretty jarring for a few reasons.\n\n1)Throughout Adventure Time, Simon character, his relationship with Betty, and other crucial aspects about his character were not clearly elaborated until Fionna and Cake. Most of the time, Simon was Ice King, who is a totally different character. When we did see him as Simon, it was merely short moments and glimpses about himself, but not so much to iron out who he really is deep down. Fionna and Cake are highlighting more about Simon as a person and his relationship to others like Betty.\n\n2)Back when he was raising Marcy, he felt like he had no choice but to keep using the ice crown in order to protect them from mutants as a result of nuclear armageddon. Simon felt like that was the only way back then to protect them. When he tells Fionna that maybe there could've been another way to survive without needing the crown, I believe he's speaking in terms of someone who has already lived through the past. Like, he is not saying that he is always known of a way to not use the crown to protect Marcy since back then, but more so in away that he's self reflecting back to a thousands years in the past and thinking that if things were done differently, he wouldn't have needed to rely on the crown. That pretty relatable, honestly. How many of us have thought about something we have done in the past and been like \"man if I just tried harder or did this thing differently back then, I could've got a better outcome?\"\n\n3)Simon confessing to Betty and her choosing not to go to Australia is apparently causing some stigma towards Simon since the thought of him going to Australia with her never crossed his mind. I mean, this sort of scenario reminds me of Ross and Rachel in the series finale of Friends. Ross goes to the airport and tells Rach his feelings before she moves away to France forever, but thought of him going to France himself never crosses his mind. There was really no ire back then, so it's weird that there apparently is for Simon (as if suddenly dropping everything and getting a ticket to fly overseas is an easy thing for anyone to do).\n\n4)Betty selflessness towards Simon has been a thing since her character was introduced. It was made out to be character flaw during the Temple of Mars episode where Finn, Jermaine, and King Man try to convince her to be a little bit more selfish and not make her life revolve around soley on Simon. It fell on deaf ears, and that is why she summoned and fused with Golb in the series finale. Hopefully, in the final 2 episodes of Fionna and Cake, Simon realises this issue, apologizes to Betty  for being so oblivious about this, and then if he actually is able to save her (God I hope he saves her), he makes a remark that while she spent most of her time trying to save him, he needs to save her this time.

{"post": {"title": "A lot of people watching Fionna and Cake have incredibly poor media literacy.", "subreddit": "adventuretime", "selftext": "I've been reading through all the discussion threads on Fionna and Cake and it feels like some people are almost intentionally obtuse when it comes to the details in this show. I can only speculate as to why but there's people making some really silly mistakes and interpreting the show wildly off from what it seems to portray \n\nThe prime and most important example for me comes in the form of the \"Simon and Bettie is creepy and that's the angle theyre going for\" argument. Primarily because - have you watched the episode??? Its never portrayed as anything creepy. It's literally portrayed from Fionna's eyes as a ridiculously romantic love story. While I agree there's an angle to be made that they're codependent or unhealthy interpreting this as the shows angle is silly when the show points to everything opposite it. Besides, we never even see the foundation for their relationship in their journey for the Enchiridion - and what we do see is almost painfully cute. \n\nAnother more silly example is with the Crown and Fionna - the entire point of the tapes from a storytelling perspective was to tell you where the crown was (LITERALLY tell you) and to hint at what happened to the world. Not realising where she got the crown is just. Agh. I find it silly Cake didn't realise, and she's a literal housecat.\n\nLast is probably the easiest mistake to make but also the most significant one - No, the Lich is not Scrabby's boss. When he says \"Thank you, Boss\" he's pretty clearly indicating the boss is giving him this opportunity to continue his self assigned mission. Its not like the Lich found Simon for him, or that it would make even a lick of sense if he was the boss here.\n\nIMO a lot of this comes down to people not fully watching the show and doing something else at the same which takes their focus and robs their ability to pay attention and pivitol moments. I get it (ADHD here), but I really feel like it's dampened people's ability to properly enjoy the important parts of the show.\n\nThat's all, sorry for this overly vitriolic and frustrated post.

Most people have poor media literacy.\n\nAs for the Simon and Betty discussion, I haven't weighed-in on it because I found it kind of nitpicky to talk about and didn't feel it was worth correcting.\n\nBut since the opportunity has arrived:\n\nSimon isn't really at fault for Betty being such a simp for him. That *is* a flaw. It's not a unambiguously always a bad one though. And the people trying to construe this as toxic are, for the lack of a better term, virtue-signaling.\n\nBetty is responsible for her own actions and by making it entirely Simon's fault, they're denying her agency. She's the one impulsively dropping everything to be with Simon. And it's pretty clear she's smitten with Simon even when everybody else thinks the man is just a crank.\n\nShe inappropriately mentions she touched hands with her idol to some random student next to her. So we know from her behavior that she's bad at reading the room or moderating her behavior if Simon is around.\n\nAnd it was entirely her choice to not take co-credit for finding the Enchiridion. Simon offered to share the limelight with her.\n\nThis is where things get complicated. A trait that's advantageous in one situation can be dysfunctional in another. Jake tends to be laidback and easygoing. This means he is flexible and deals with adversity pretty well because he doesn't become too invested in the outcome of anything. But we're also shown he can be pretty irresponsible, flaky and that he will crumble/surrender if he can't simply go around or ignore a problem.\n\nHe claims he has a Buddha-like detachment, which we know to be lie from the Pillow World episode. He throws away a favorite mug to make a philosophical point to Finn. But we find him with the mug later in the episode, showing he is not nearly as good at dealing with loss as he likes to pretend.\n\nIn another episode he is cursed to lose his stretchy powers by a witch and he mostly just gives up and lies around doing nothing, rather than try to reclaim his powers. Even though there is a clear culprit and an actual way to get back his powers.\n\nSo sure, Betty is capable of giving Simon the most passionate and romantic love he's ever experienced in his life.  But also, what kind of woman will jump through a time portal to save Simon from himself?\n\nWell, it's what we saw. One that will drop all her plans impulsively to be with him. But her inability to let go is partly why this whole nonsense with Golb happened and why she had a pretty toxic and manipulative relationship with Ice King. She's willing to go insane to be Magic Woman for the sole purpose of helping Simon.\n\nSimon's fault in all this, I think, is that he views Betty too much with rose-tinted glasses. He's too in love with her to actually understand how self-destructive and impulsive she is. She's self-sacrificing to a fault. And I suppose that's a bit of deconstruction of the 'true love conquers all' trope.\n\nThe reality is that if the Mushroom Wars never happened and magic never turned Earth into the land of Ooo, Simon and Betty probably could've gone on to have a fairly normal relationship.

That doesn't even make sense that Lich's one is the one that influences the timeline while Finn's one creates a new universe.

Lich's world isn't prime Ooo and we know that because Ice King has his jewels which he doesn't have at that time during prime Ooo. Unless you want to believe that the wish went slightly back in time but that would just be such a random thing that makes no sense for the wish. There's also the fact that Finn left a BRB note which he didn't do in the episode before he entered the timeroom. Unless you want to say he left that note off screen but not only is that trying too desperately to cling onto a theory that is just wrong but it also doesn't make sense considering what happened in \"The Lich\". Finn and Jake just go to check up on Billy after Finn's dream, they had no attention on going on a whole adventure with him until Lich Billy... Bichy tricked Finn into doing it.", "ups": 0, "depth": 5, "author": "FloshaForest", "replies": [{"selftext": "&gt;And we only found out about new universes being created by wishes in Fionna and Cake\n\nWe didn't, we found that out back at the start of season 5. Prismo tells Jake that Finn's wish transported him to a wish altered reality. We've know about this since all the way back then.\n\n&gt;It seems to be a relatively common problem that people view a plot hole as something that logically could/should've been done rather than what the characters would've done. Ignoring everything we know Finn and Jake were under the full impression that their world was gone, even if their world was fine that doesn't matter because they aren't all-knowing, they don't know what we know.\n\nBut Prismo does. My issue isn't with Finn and Jake's decision-making. They were working with the information they had available. My issue is with what Prismo said back in the episodes Finn the Human and Jake the Dog.\n\nWhen he talks to Jake about where Finn went, he specifically tells us that he left the time room and went to his own wish altered reality. BUT, when he talks about the Lich's wish, he says that his wish altered his timeline, and when Jake asks why they're still safe if that's the case, Prismo doesn't say \"because his wish sent him to an alternate reality so it doesn't affect you\". He says the reason they're safe is because they're safe inside the time room, implying that if they were back in Ooo instead, they would have been killed by the Lich's wish.\n\n&gt;Now onto the Lich wish. Prismo was saying the same thing in both cases, you are overthinking things.\n\nNope. Watch the episodes again. He says two different things for each wish. And if what you're saying is true, you need to explain why Prismo didn't at any point in the two episodes simply explain to Finn and Jake that they could safely return home and that the Lich was gone forever to his own world. You need to explain why Prismo didn't tell Jake to just wish for him and Finn to be back in Ooo, and why he specifically guided him to change the Lich's wish instead. The simplest explanation is that what Prismo said is accurate. That Finn's wish created an alternate reality, but the Lich's wish simply altered his own, which is why they couldn't simply return, and why Jake had to change the Lich's wish in order to make everything go back to normal.\n\n&gt;That doesn't even make sense that Lich's one is the one that influences the timeline while Finn's one creates a new universe. Finn's one was to change the timeline so that the Lich never existed while Lich's one was something that wouldn't need to change the timeline so I think it is a bit out there to try and claim Lich's wish is the only one that didn't create a new universe.\n\nOn the contrary. Finn's wish made changes to the world in the past, so a new timeline had to be created for that. The Lich's wish didn't modify anything back in time. His wish acted in the present/future, so his wish was able to modify his existing world. It makes perfect sense why one wish stemmed a new reality while the other didn't.\n\n&gt;Lich's world isn't prime Ooo and we know that because Ice King has his jewels which he doesn't have at that time during prime Ooo.\n\nWhen the portal closed at the end of the episode The Lich (season 4 finale), we see the Jewels respawned back in the world. And thanks to the end of the episode Jake the Dog, we know that they quickly levitate a few seconds later and fly back to their original places. So yes, the jewls were there and Ice King had them.\n\n&gt;There's also the fact that Finn left a BRB note which he didn't do in the episode before he entered the timeroom. Unless you want to say he left that note off screen but not only is that trying too desperately to cling onto a theory that is just wrong but it also doesn't make sense considering what happened in \"The Lich\". Finn and Jake just go to check up on Billy after Finn's dream, they had no attention on going on a whole adventure with him until Lich Billy... Bichy tricked Finn into doing it.\n\nSo either your theory is correct, and you have to explain why Prismo didn't provide crucial information to Finn and Jake, and why he led Jake to believe that he had to make a muvh more complex wish than he needed to, or my theory is correct, and I have to explain why Finn left BMO a note when he left in the middle of the night...\n\nI think I'll take my chances. The Lich dead world being prime Ooo is much more well supported than the alternative.\n\nEDIT: u/FloshaForest I'm sure you won't see this but since you asked me a question before blocking me I'll still answer.\n\nWell, our Finn and Farmworld Finn were once the same person, and they were split by time shenanigans in the time room. The Finn sword and Finn were once the same person, and they were split by time shenanigans in the time room.\n\nI see no reason why the crew wouldn't apply the exact same logic to Ooo, having it split due to time shenanigans in the time room\n\nOh and thanks for blocking me by the way, very nice.

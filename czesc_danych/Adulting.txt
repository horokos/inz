CONGRATS, I have written some how-to\u2019s for you so you can start to get your fucking shit together. \n\n[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bgzqbc/how_to_be_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult/)\n\n[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh0m1l/being_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult_part/)\n\n[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh3evn/how_to_be_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult/)\n\n[Adulting with Depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh4lzh/how_to_adult_when_you_are_too_depressed_to/)\n\nHere are some fucking FAQ\u2019s on the parts I wrote so that you don\u2019t have to scroll through and upvote every single nice comment in the comment section on all of the parts. \n\nQ: Are there going to be more parts?\n\nA: Yeah probably. But I have a fucking life where I do things that aren\u2019t writing how-to\u2019s, so they will arrive whenever I am feeling generous enough to give advice and have the energy to write about said advice. \n\nQ: You should write a book.\n\nA: Thank you, I am. The book is in the works, basically it\u2019s a fucking 100-page rant where I talk about how to wash your balls. \n\nQ: How old are you? Are you a boy or a girl?\n\nA: I am an adult. I will not tell you my age because once I do you will suddenly have all these pre-conceived judgements about the quality of the advice I give. But here is a hint, I am older than 18 and younger than 50. I am a person. Take a guess on my gender and if you get it right Ill give you a fucking star. \n\nQ: Why can\u2019t you write normally?\n\nA: Because there are a bajillion fucking self-help books out there written normally, and there are like 5 that are written in a way that people fucking relate to and listen to. If cursing *turns you off* then good. I only want readers who can fucking read this shit with a boner 6 miles long. \n\nQ: I have a tip that you don\u2019t mention, can you add it to the article?\n\nA: Sure, if its actually fucking good. Send me a message with your advice that you think is good enough to make it, and I\u2019ll add it to the end of the article and credit you. \n\nQ: I run a podcast/YouTube channel/ blog, can I interview you or have you guest speak?\n\nA: Generally, yes. My time is precious, so if you want me to write something completely new for your shit its going to take a while and will probably cost you more than exposure. \n\nQ: What do you do when you aren\u2019t cussing people out on the internet?\n\nA: I own a business and am a stay at home parent. When I am not writing, I am packing orders, creating or listing new product, taking care of my son, or playing with my two dogs. I rarely have any down time.\n\nIf you have more questions you want answered or have an idea for an article you want me to write, send me a PM.

Oh no, something went totally over your head. What are we going to do? Wow, look at your hair, it's all messed up from that whoosh. We should have done this on Halloween so we could tell everybody your hair is part of your costume.\n\nLet me see if I can slow down my words...c a n  y o u  u n d e r s t a n d  m e  n o w ? ? ?\n\nWell let me see if I can explain this. If you're written an article about how to be an adult, you don't use a headline that makes you sound like a total douchebag. Why you may ask? Well for people that are not total douchebags, they're not going to be interested in pursuing an article with a headline that reads as if it written by an apparent douchebag.\n\nPicture yourself thumbing through a magazine and you see an ad for designer jeans. Do they have an ugly person for a model? No they don't. Why is that you may ask? It's because people don't stop and look at ugly people. In the same way. People don't stop for ugly headlines.\n\nAnother take on this: You're shopping for a new car. Do you stop and look at a Yugo? No, not because they haven't been made since the 80s. You don't stop because they are ugly cars. Unless of course you're ugly, in which case you bond with the Yugo, and possibly start a new family. Picture baby Yugo Matchbox cars running around the house.\n\nYou're wheeling around your infant four wheeled wonder, and the neighbor stops to admire. One look at that abomination, I mean you delightful baby Yugo, and your neighbor punches you in the nose for bringing such a hideous beast into the world. Cursing you that such beasts only belong in the book of revelations.\n\nHearing such words makes you want to offer the lovely Christian a Bud Light and a rainbow flag, uttering the words \"Taste the rainbow.\" He glances at your crotch with its Ken doll smoothness and says \"Those aren't Skittles, they're barely Chiclets.\" Little do you know after church your neighbor cruises the \"gay\" strip, but only to make sinners repent. Don't, please don't, tell your neighbor that get spit roasted by two dudes isn't called repenting.\n\nDoes this let the air out of your tires? Turn your coupe into a cabriolet? Of course it does, but you have only yourself to blame. After all, you could have dated that lovely Porsche that was eying you up at the county fair. Instead you went for the low hanging fruit. If you're at a retirement home, watch out for the low hanging fruit. You quickly find that one man's low hanging fruit is his sagging ball sack.\n\nNow, isn't it perfectly clear what I am talking about?", "ups": 2, "depth": 2, "author": "aabum", "replies": [{"selftext": "&gt;\u261d total douchebag", "ups": 2, "depth": 3, "author": "wowjb12", "replies": [{"selftext": "Congratulations,  you can type while looking at yourself in the mirror.", "ups": 1, "depth": 4, "author": "aabum", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"selftext": "Nice", "ups": 7, "depth": 0, "author": "Easeupp", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "What?", "ups": 5, "depth": 0, "author": "Christin_aka_Chris", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "um when u wrote this post u were in ur 20s :P and u prob a man", "ups": 6, "depth": 0, "author": "depressedpotato_69", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Apparently some of the kids don't like your \"angry aggressive\" writing.

{"post": {"title": "I think we need to normalize the single with no kids lifestyle because there\u2019s nothing wrong or weird about it.", "subreddit": "Adulting", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking this a lot lately and commented on someone else\u2019s post so this  is basically just copy and pasted  my comment with a few changes. \n\nIm a single guy with no kids in my 30s and I have a few thoughts on this. It used to bother me so much and made me so depressed so i don\u2019t know if my views originated from me justifying and making excuses to feel better about it but either way they do help me when I think about it. \n\nI have a theory that not everyone is meant to be in a relationship and/or start a family. Plain and simple and it needs to start being normalized since were programmed from an extremely young age to believe that we are and everyone HAS to get married and have kids and you\u2019re weird or there\u2019s something wrong with you if you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like that at all. So, instead of always looking for \u201cthe one\u201d I just live my life thinking (knowing really) that there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019m one of those people who\u2019s just not cut out for relationships and family and that\u2019s ok. Ive actually been much happier with this mindset. If a girl comes along and sweeps me off my feet, awesome. If not, that\u2019s cool too. Plus, I do like my freedom tbh. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is  try not to think about it  and let it bother you so much. It\u2019s ok to be forever single with no kids. Theres nothing wrong with you. It doesn\u2019t make you weird and fuck people who think it does. Theres no rule in life that\u2019s says you MUST marry and reproduce. It\u2019s also nice to always keep your options open. At the end of the day it\u2019s up to you how much you let it bother you.\n\nAlso having a kid means it\u2019s just another human to annoy someone one day and possibly ruin their day, contribute to destroying the earth, and another person who\u2019s blood will be used to fuel the capitalist machine. Big picture? I like to think I\u2019m being part of the solution, not part of the problem by not reproducing. Humans are awful and are getting worse. We\u2019re a bacteria that\u2019s infected and is killing the earth. The fact that scientists have figured out climate change is mainly from humans proves my point further. We gave the earth a fever. \n\nSo again, if you\u2019re single with no kids and it bothers you, dont think about it and just live your life dammit!

A lot of the time you go through a couple of weeks of Quality Assurance training after they teach you the main points of the job so you have someone with you to tell you what you can say during certain moments or find things you're struggling with.\n\nMy current job doesn't require much small talk at all unless the customer starts it because it's literally just asking questions, filling out a form, delivering the rate and information and if they want to buy take a payment.

When applying for them, think about the kind of calls you'd be taking. Collections Agencies are gonna be a lot of angry people, I wouldn't work for one bc I couldn't handle those kinds of calls.

My wife is employed by a medical provider that operates clinics offering testing, prevention services, and treatment. Her role as a patient care coordinator involves following up with patients who receive positive test results and ensuring they are well-informed about treatment options, follow-up appointments, and related matters. In the past, her job adhered to the traditional 8-to-5 in-office schedule from Monday to Friday.In contrast, I have been immersed in the IT field for over a decade. My career journey has taken me from IT support roles in various call centers to my current position within the same company. I've transitioned from day-to-day customer support to an internal inspection role. In this capacity, I'm an integral part of a team responsible for reviewing internal processes and collaborating with the internal quality assurance department. To put it succinctly, when you hear a company's announcement that they may record your call for quality assurance purposes, I'm one of the individuals entrusted with listening to those calls.The company I work for is a multinational corporation with a global presence. We are contracted by other companies to provide IT support across various industries, including automotive, defense contracting, banking, healthcare, and more. Essentially, if an organization relies on computers, we provide the necessary support.Before the pandemic, I had already gained experience in a hybrid work environment, splitting my time between the office and working from home a couple of days a week. However, since the advent of COVID-19, both our employers have recognized the cost-effectiveness of reducing office space and maintaining a significant remote workforce. As a result, there are no plans to return either of us to an office setting anytime soon.The advantages of this arrangement are significant. We now enjoy a much more relaxed work environment, free from the daily commute, which saves us several hours each day. Consequently, our vehicles are seeing much less mileage; we used to cover approximately 20,000 miles in each car annually, but now we're down to around 6,000 miles, primarily because we've opted for more leisurely road trips. This has led to significant savings on gas expenses.For me personally, the flexibility of not adhering to a strict schedule is a major benefit. As long as I meet my work deliverables and attend a few weekly meetings, I don't need to clock in or out. I have the freedom to work at my own pace. During the summer, I even reserve a standing early morning tee time every Friday, while my wife maintains her 8-to-5 schedule.Moreover, household chores have become much more manageable. Tasks such as yard care, laundry, cooking, and grocery shopping can be easily integrated into our workday.However, there are some downsides to consider. Both of our industries, especially mine, are trending towards hiring lower-paid workers overseas, which has raised concerns about job security. Additionally, most days, the only in-person interactions we have are with each other and our son, who is now back in school, spending most of the day away from home.The easy access to food at home has posed a personal challenge for me, as it hasn't been kind to my waistline. However, I'm actively working on adopting healthier eating habits.Lastly, we've experienced the inconvenience of internet and power outages, which can disrupt our work.Neither of us earns a six-figure salary; my wife makes approximately $55,000, and I earn around $75,000 per year. However, we both believe that given our current experience levels, these figures should be 30% higher for each of us.If you're considering work-from-home opportunities, fields such as IT, medical billing, insurance processing, freelance writing, and translation services offer accessible entry points.\n\nI forgot to add that during most of my work day, I have youtube playing in the background as I do my work.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "Difficult_Rooster796", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "I am an editor.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "TheInvisibleWun", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "I have hybrid.

{"post": {"title": "I\u2019m Crushing On A Taken Guy And Need A Reality Check", "subreddit": "Adulting", "selftext": "Okay, I (19f) am in an EKG tech class. There is a really cute guy in it who we\u2019ll name Ty for protective purposes. Ty is a Hispanic guy originally from South America who is very friendly, calm, and smart. Recently, I\u2019ve been noticing some mixed signs that he may be crushing as well even though he has a girlfriend. The first time we really interacted, we had to practice taking vitals (blood pressure, bpm, the works) on each other. We laughed and smiled with each other basically every second. That same day, when Ty left, he waited a few seconds to say goodbye to me. He didn\u2019t interact with anyone else at all, not even the instructor. His phone also lit up during the class activity and I asked if his Lock Screen was him and his mom, but he said kind of disappointedly that it was his girlfriend. He seemed like he didn\u2019t want to bring her up. The next couple of classes, whenever we had to practice vitals or something, Ty would come up to me first before anyone else. I\u2019m comfortable with him because he\u2019s gentle and makes sure I\u2019m comfortable. Anyway, I\u2019ve also noticed that he\u2019ll stand next to me a lot and lean somewhat closer. Today, he wore cologne that I could smell very clearly. I complimented him on it (cologne is a weakness for me) and he seemed satisfied that I noticed. I know that could just be a man\u2019s thing in general but I\u2019ve never smelled cologne on him before this class. One last thing I\u2019ve noticed was that today he asked me about some assignments right as we were leaving class, as if he was finding an excuse to talk to me. He didn\u2019t talk to anyone else unless it was during an activity in class where he had to practice vitals or something. We walked out of the room together to talk before saying bye to each other and heading our separate ways. I know all of this stuff is most likely him being nice and friendly towards me because I sit across from him and interact with him a lot, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if a tiny part is him crushing on me. Again, he has a girlfriend, and I\u2019ve never made any moves towards him, so I\u2019m confused on what could be possibly happening. If anyone could give me some advice on how to handle these feelings, I would so appreciate it.

I do understand your point too, however, because way too often people with disabilities, genetic conditions and chronic illnesses are forgotten or dismissed in conversations about health, and that's unfair and sad.

For example I have a family member that definitely won the genetic lottery, he's been a smoker for almost 50 years yet still healthy, but he's overweight and recently had to get a tutor for his knees because walking hurts him. He doesn't have anything physical preventing him from being a healthy weight, he's just stubborn and refuses to take care of his health, so after 20+ years of being overweight his knees couldn't handle it anymore and he can't walk or stand very long without pain. If he hadn't been overweight and he took regular walks, his knees probably would've lasted him until his late 80s or 90s (he's just 63 now).

For example don't watch videos or engage in anything that might prevent you from relaxing. If your room has light coming in, consider getting light dampening shade for the window. There's also night time blindfolds as well as things to reduce sound.

But here\u2019s what I\u2019d tell an American woman in your shoes, and maybe some of it will help. \n\nThe best way to get ahead would be to make a plan to live far, FAR below your means for 3-6 months and save VERY aggressively. This is going to sound extreme but hear me out. \n\nIn the ideal scenario, you would get the cheapest (temporary-ish) housing possible without sacrificing safety. I mean like renting a room in a house; being a caretaker for a home while the owners are away; living with an older person for free in exchange for helping with household tasks. In addition to paying the absolute minimum for housing, you want to live the most basic life reasonably possible. Make all your meals at home. Buy rice and beans and only very basic meat, only fresh fruits/veggies when on sale; supplement with frozen veggies etc. Eat as cheaply as you can without sacrificing health. Budget a very small amount for one takeout/treat/indulgence a week. Commit to buying no unnecessary clothes, shoes, accessories, electronics, etc. for at least 3-6 months. \n\nDuring this time, your goal is to save as much as humanly possible of your take-home salary without sacrificing safety or health. It should feel like your life is safe but not lavish or fun. Put all that money into a high yield savings plan. At the end of 3-6 months of doing this, you will look at your savings account and you will know two things: (1) what you\u2019re capable of surviving on at a bare minimum; and (2) that you are free. \n\nMoney doesn\u2019t buy happiness but it can buy freedom. Shield that savings. Keep it in a high yield account so it grows, but do NOT treat it as a rainy day fund. This money is for emergencies and important life investments. It\u2019s for paying off a medical bill or to cover an unexpected urgent expense (like replacing the tires on your car when they\u2019re dangerously old; not like buying a new pair of designer shoes). \n\nThis money will not make you rich\u2014because you will never spend it the way a rich person could\u2014but it is money that will free you from being poor. It will be there for you to prevent any hand to mouth situations.

{"post": {"title": "Questions with finances and controlling parents, help please :(", "subreddit": "Adulting", "selftext": "I think maybe I was not supposed to put this in personal finance, but the more answers the better. \n\nHello guys, I would like to make my own money from a small business, like Redbubble or INPRNT. I have wanted to do this for a long time. I would like to build up savings so I can buy personal items, and making things for others online seems great.\n\nI know my parents will not let me for many reasons. They haven account with me right now where all my money is at \u201cBofA.\u201d My parents are super traditional and paranoid; they don\u2019t trust me. They think I\u2019m going to sell myself to some drug dealer if I have control of my account freely, or blow it on remote vacations to seedy places, or something. I\u2019m an adult if that is relevant and live with them. Please assume they will not budge on this. I don\u2019t need judgements about my parents; I already know what they are.\n\nI am looking at the capital one 360 account, by the way. I will use a new email.\n\nHere are my questions.\n\n1. If I open a new account and they know my SSN, will they know I have a new account? Is there ANY WAY of them knowing if I have my own bank account? If I click the paperless statements option, will I get ANY mail from the bank at all? Do I NEED a physical card if all I want is to make online payments with that account?\n\nMy plan is to get an online wallet and never get a physical card until I get away from my address, get paperless statements, and get money put into the account from my online business.\n\n2. If I transfer money from my joint account to my new account, will they know? I\u2019m guessing: yes. But will they know it is a capital one banking account?\n\nI do not plan to move all my money because they will definitely know. I want to start making separate money from them.\n\n3. What about taxes? Will they see it on taxes? I am guessing not because now that I am an adult I have to file my taxes myself. They can\u2019t see a new bank account because they can\u2019t look at my taxes, right?\n\n4. I know taxes are probably going to be a problem. What should I do to prepare for filing taxes, if I plan to have a small online business? Do I have to file as a self employment? I have another real job. I live in the US.\n\n5. can I file taxes for both bank accounts without my parents knowing, when tax season comes around?\n\nIf I want to make my own business I need this new account. They will be very very mad if they find out about this account.\n\nIf you read this all thank you so much and I heart you forever. I\u2019m sorry that this is probably annoying and needy and brainless to ask. I know there are online resources, I just really, really need assurance from real humans that they won\u2019t know anything about this new account.\n\nThank you very much, again, for reading.", "ups": 1, "permalink": "/r/Adulting/comments/16sms7f/questions_with_finances_and_controlling_parents/", "num_comments": 13}, "replies": [{"selftext": "They will not, but I recommend opening a Sofi account so that you get 4.5% interest on your money!(also not official financial advice)\n\nCheck it out!\n\n[https://www.sofi.com/invite/invest?gcp=75bcd8a8-f276-413c-9615-160d18fb10b7&amp;isAliasGcp=false](https://www.sofi.com/invite/invest?gcp=75bcd8a8-f276-413c-9615-160d18fb10b7&amp;isAliasGcp=false)", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "chickensandonospicy", "replies": [{"selftext": "What won\u2019t they see?

Before my current role I handled clinical placements. I used to sit in these big annual meetings with the region's largest hospital systems where they'd talk about their biggest shortages being in nurses with over 3 years experience. They use it as a huge selling point on why we need to train more nurses and how serious the shortages are. After years of it, I started to become really disillusioned and it was hard to hold my tongue. This country doesn't have a nursing shortage. It has a nurse retention problem. This healthcare system chews up nurses and spits them out to benefit the bottom line. Some actuary did calculations to figure out how few nurses hospitals could employ to keep negative outcomes below a certain threshold and that's how they staff. Screw the patients who get harmed. They're accounted for in the cost of doing business. Screw the people who they wear down and chase out of the profession. Increasing profits is god.\n\nMy cousin was born with a very rare heart defect. He's only alive because his nurse saw another baby with that defect in her 30 years of work. His outcome was very good because she experienced another baby going through it and not having the best outcome. A nurse of 1 year doesn't have the experience to catch the rare stuff. To notice problems really early. Etc. The way hospitals don't care about that really pisses me off and makes me cynical. As does the misery nurses are put through. I sometimes feel really guilty.

Routines and some expectations is exactly what one needs most of the time (and just the emotional support of having your partner is invaluable). Also, if you\u2019re partner is depressed, and isn\u2019t seeking help, I think it\u2019s a great thing for you to initiate them getting help or treatment. A depressive state is not something that\u2019ll probably just go away if ignored, but when you\u2019re depressed you just hunker down and it feeds off itself. \n\nAlso, really - don\u2019t be afraid to be firm and keep some expectations. When you\u2019re depressive it\u2019s a chronic spiral and it\u2019ll just get worse if left to fester. It\u2019s unfair to put this on you, but if you want things to happen more frequently, try doing more telling/demanding not asking or \u201cnagging\u201d. Also immediacy helps too. Perceived \u201coptions\u201d is basically the daily mental Hell we\u2019re battling to make ourselves do the things we\u2019re supposed to in a day. Instead of \u201cwill you PLEASE go to the grocery store?\u201d Try: \u201cWe\u2019re grocery shopping in 10 minutes. Get on your clothes\u201d or \u201chere\u2019s the shopping list. Pick them up today after work\u201d.  \u201cI just cooked. Do the dishes\u201d etc. \u201cWe\u2019re going out to dinner tonight\u201d. \u201cBe showered and ready in 30\u201d etc.  (assuming if your partner is really f*cked up they\u2019ll be late. But keep trying to make them show up to things). \n\nMy Partner is very non-judgmental when I\u2019m in a depressive hole, and she\u2019s been undeservedly supportive. She lets some things slide, and doesn\u2019t say mean things if she came home and I\u2019ve laid in bed all day etc. - ie she\u2019s very talented at not laying on any further guilt. BUT she may see that I\u2019ve laid in bed all day - and firmly snap, \u201cI\u2019m going on my run in 15 minutes. Put on your running clothes\u201d ;-) \n\nWhen you\u2019re depressed you feel guilty ALL the time - you\u2019re exhausted, lethargic and you can\u2019t get yourself to do anything. Everything and anything is a task that feels too hard and everything is something to be dreaded. So you shy away and start having avoidance of all the things you feel guilty about - on top of feeling apathy so it\u2019s hard to care that the things that are important aren\u2019t getting done - and it feeds and feeds until you\u2019re barely functioning. On top of that, you literally drop in IQ while depressed. You are - in fact - dumber. Which makes work and such more difficult which doesn\u2019t help the spiral. And often, when you feel crappy you take it out on those around you or at least suck all the energy out of the room and don\u2019t have much support for anyone else. It\u2019s absolutely no fun being around someone depressive. \n\n**If nothing is working, and you aren\u2019t seeing changes, remember, YOUR mental health is important too. If you have to leave, leave. It\u2019s not on you to fix your SO - and at the end of the day, you don\u2019t have the power to fix them. They have to fix themselves. Nothing you are doing or \u201cfailing\u201d to do has anything to do with their mental health condition. You can try to be supportive and help if you wish, but at the end of this, it\u2019s up to them to change. Just keep that perspective, and don\u2019t sacrifice yourself for someone who won\u2019t ever be able to reciprocate**\n\nBut, if it is relatively new or something temporary - having expectations, keeping a routine, staying physically active, and having an support network can all be extremely helpful. No matter how bad I get, my partner tells me I\u2019m cooking some of the meals every week, to do the dishes when I\u2019ve been laying around too much even if I am tired, she gets twitchy and makes me go on a run with her or at least on a walk if she\u2019s assessed I\u2019m being particularly pathetic and can\u2019t get up to a run. She tells me to shower, snaps at me/doesn\u2019t have much patience for when I fall into unhealthy pattern like if I uselessly wallow or start speaking pessimistically about myself or the world or whatever. It\u2019s not perfect of course. There\u2019s plenty of times she gives up, or I\u2019m an a** or the dishes sit for 2 days till I do them. But she displays healthy habits and behaviors and keeps expectations that within reason I follow similar habits. She helps me a lot and I appreciate it. It makes it easier for me to do my best to shape up and get out of my own feelings, to put out the extra effort when I notice she\u2019s struggling on a given day herself, to muster up more energy to do chores and be a better partner in the household upkeep etc. I personally also do well with sticky notes because I get so forgetful of what I\u2019m supposed to do. \n\nIt CAN be extremely helpful to take the initiative to sit down and strong arm us like a freaking toddler to do something we need to do. Or - in general - to just do things together. Like if they need to pay off a bill - say they have the funds - they just can\u2019t get themselves to log in to the portal - sit down with your SO, open the laptop, and sit there with them till they do it. Something you\u2019re just dreading a task beyond all reason, even often really simple tasks just need moral support. \n\nMy partner does sometimes step in and do things I can\u2019t get myself to do. She sat down with me, and made me call and leave a voicemail for my now main psychiatrist years ago. She made me follow up to make an appointment. I\u2019ve had that same great psych for 6 years. Those little pushes can be soooo helpful.\n\nThere\u2019s also coping mechanisms your partner should work on. Building habits when they feel good, which they can fall back on when they hit an episode, saving up vacation or sick leave and building a heftier emergency savings fund if they need to take temporary work leave. Having some tricks to allow some forgiveness if some of their day to day tasks get dropped a little without life around them spiraling further - for example: having two laundry hampers for when they can\u2019t get themselves to fold laundry - one is clean, one is dirty - and then everything isn\u2019t on the floor causing a mess or laundry isn\u2019t being avoided as much.

Depression and your personality are two separate things by the way. Someone can be very self-centered, and outgoing and perfectly happy with no depression after all. Try not to lump these things together. Just think of how almost everyone has had down periods in their life - depression, simplified, is just when people experience levels that impede their day to day function. And the variation of severity is vast. \n\nMany - in fact - the majority of people will suffer from one depressive episode in their lifetime. It\u2019s often initiated by an environmental factor - high stress, life transitions, seasonal changes, age (common in middle school and again in people\u2019s 20\u2019s) etc. with various solutions. Many people go through an episode or episodes in their life without even realizing it happened, and with time and relief or recovery from what is a temporary stressor condition (death of a loved one, stressful time at work, difficult periods of life transition like a move etc), and with some time, they get themselves back to full normal function naturally. Most going through that experience would have probably benefited from therapy - but some people may require counseling and therapeutic support to recover, fewer still may require medication but are pretty fine as long as they have proper treatment - just like many health conditions (roughly 30% of unipolar depressives are stable on simple SSRI meds) \n\nMost people it\u2019s somewhat genetic and the tendency for higher rates of depression often runs in your family. It doesn\u2019t mean it is always constant either. That\u2019s why often referred to as depressive \u201cepisodes\u201d. Think of it like getting a mental flu. You may have to take it a lighter load for a while, or go see your doctor or councilor to have some extra support till you can get out of the episode. You could have only a handful of major episodes in your lifetime. Some people have seasonal depression - it only happens during a specific season. That\u2019s referred to Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Some have low-grade depression all the time - those are often maybe don\u2019t feel like that as soon as they are put on the right medication. But many can mitigate symptoms and stay mentally healthy and happy with simple healthy living, good habits, and exercise daily. It\u2019s just that sometimes a hiccup in life may have a higher risk compared to other people of being more mentally effected. Whereas maybe you skip working out for a few months and you don\u2019t feel much change in mood, maybe someone with low-grade depression really has to stick to a strict regimen to feel normal.  And sometimes, no matter how regulated you are, life throws a curveball, and you may need a little more support than others to handle it if you get knock you down. \n\nAlso, variations can be from just being a little \u201cflat\u201d or \u201cnumb\u201d with some lower energy, to someone who can\u2019t get themselves out of bed for days at a time, to suicidal etc. \n\nPeople stay with someone with depression for the same reasons anyone puts up with the flaws of their partners - because it\u2019s only one aspect of someone\u2019s life - they may be funny and fine most of the time, or provide something to the relationship the other partner needs. \n\nIf it was all-consuming, and the partner truly never seems able to reciprocate in the relationship, that\u2019s a different matter - and people do split for this reason all the time, just like they split for any other reason that makes a relationship unhealthy. \n\nI was just listing what my SO has done when I\u2019ve been in a peak bad episode. I have my own personality, with it\u2019s good traits and bad outside of any mood disorder that may occasionally crop up and some qualities that seems to make it worth it to her to stick around through my gloomy periods. For example, I am usually quite cheerful and my humor matches her own so I know how to make her laugh and can cheer her up quite a lot when she\u2019s stressed or upset. I am also pretty laid back to live with and she can relax around me in a way she maybe couldn\u2019t with others. I\u2019m also a little more spontaneous when I feel fine and we enjoy each other\u2019s company and similar activities and have the same life values. That\u2019s a lot going for us.

Sometimes men think they have to be stoic or keep it bottled up or keep everything on their shoulders.\n\n\nTry talking to them tell them they can open up to you about how they're feeling. Be as open and calm as possible with them and lead with showing they can be vulnerable.

It was the first show of affection from her in a while and it made me feel so good. \n\n\nIdk what the situation is exactly but maybe they need a break from work. If they are lucky and work a decent white collar job there is likely a medical leave of absence available (usually it's non paid though or reduced salary) . \n\n\nOr take a weekend trip, maybe something in nature. Look up forest bathing (basically hiking) it's been shown to help with mental issues. \n\n\nAlso maybe consider their diet and exercise. Doesn't have to be anything extreme but that's been shown to help if they have the time for it.\n\n\nSupplement wise creatine and maca powder helped me ( I put both in my coffee but maca blend s easier in smoothies).

Also, here are a few actual hacks for not wasting food:\n\n1 - When you open a can of tomato paste because you need one tablespoon, lay out a sheet of plastic (Saran wrap or a piece of a plastic bag) and spoon out the rest of the can in one-tablespoon blobs and lay them out on the plastic.  Then role up the plastic and put it in the freezer. Next time you need a tablesoon of tomatoe paste you just throw in one of your tomato ice cubes.\n\n2 - same with fresh herbs like cilantro.  If you only need a bit, portion out the rest and put it in small containers or an ice cube tray filled with water and freeze it.\n\n3 - buy a dehydrator off FB marketplace.  I got mine for $20.  Some veggies, like celery, deyhydrate really well.  I just cut it up, dehydrate it, and store it dry in my cupboard for when it need it in soups, stews, etc.\n\n4 - Some fresh veggies, like potatoes, onions, squash, and even carrots and beets last a long time unrefrigerated if you store them right. Cabbage lasts a long time in the frige. So focus on learning to cook yummy recipes with these things.\n\n5 - if you don't drink a lot of milk, consider buying powdered...especially if you mostly just need it for cooking.\n\n6 - Invest in a huge array of spices.  You can make vastly different foods with the same ingedients if you've got a robust spice collection.  The same bag of lentils can be used in Ethiopian wot, Indian Daal and Mexican Chili. ...three totally different meals.  Don't buy the crazy expensive little spice containers at the grocery store.

Taking some time- 15-20 minutes to plan a week or even a month of menus and write a proper grocery list will help you save time and money in the long run. \n\nBuying strategically can help with food going bad but requires you to eat foods in the order in which they will go bad first--not based off of what you \"want\" to eat.

If I don't eat it in two days it goes bad. \n\nBut examples would be: salad mix and in season berries: goes bad very fast eat first. \n\nBroccoli and oranges: go bad after about 5 days - a week ish. Eat second\n\nApples (in the fridge), whole uncut melons, whole squashes-- last for a while. Eat last\n\nBuy meats and cook all of it on one day: refrigerate a few days worth of food and freeze the rest in single serve portions. Then heat and serve. \n\nIn that vein spending an hour meal prepping things like meats, roasted veggies, cutting fruit  etc will allow you to have \"5 min meals\" in the moment.

You're driving or paying for delivery fees which all adds up plus it's not as satiating because it lacks nutrients your body needs so you end up eating more/ buying more.

I know food prices in the store have gone up too but I believe I can make a better burger for less from the store.

It's cheaper if you actually use up the ingredients.

It is a skill you acquire through experience, and knowing the best way to utilize your ingredients. Me buying an ingredient is more about \"How many uses can I get out of this,\" than \"I need this one ingredient for this one specific dish.\" For example, I got celery for soup, and had a ton leftover. I made hummus so I could snack on the celery, and froze the scraps that were going bad to make veggie broth out of it. It's okay to buy an ingredient for a new dish that you want to try out, but generally, try to purchase ingredients that you know you will use throughout the week.

For example, I would often spend $20-$25 on a corned beef, put it in the slow cooker, and have corned beef and cabbage for two meals, corned beef sandwiches another, and then maybe get another meal out of that. I think that's a pretty good deal for a piece of meat and a cabbage.\n\nAnother thing I'd do is find the cheapest cut of beef they had, doesn't matter how tough. Stick that in the slow cooker with some beef broth, dried onion, bay leaf, and eventually some barley and that's a soup. I got multiple meals out of that and it froze well. If you don't want to eat the same thing for the next couple of days, portion out some in freezer bags and stick it in the freezer.\n\nCornmeal is great because cornbread is super easy to make, either the skillet or hot water version and you can also make grits if you like those. Jiffy mix is super cheap too, like 68 cents and it makes 6 muffins or so. Get some collard greens and a smoked ham hock and you have a dinner for at least two days. Pasta dishes are also pretty economical too. If you are cooking for 1, you can use half a jar if you don't want leftovers and just freeze the rest of the sauce to use another day. Pasta is always great to have on hand because it lasts a long time.\n\nEven McDonalds is expensive these days, so for the price of one meal at McDonals, you can probably get two or three meals cooking at home you just have to look at items in terms of how many meals you can get out of it.  \n\n\nEdited to add: Buying fresh vegetables is fine, but I would recommend buying them for something you are going to make either that day or the next.

I had tons leftover, and no other recipes calling for tamarind. If you don't have money to waste on mistakes like this, you need to organize your kitchen around *staples*. This means to have certain ingredients on-hand that can be easily used in a number of different recipes, and try your best to stick to those recipes. \n\nFor example, you could always have pasta and canned tomatoes on hand, so spaghetti is always an option. If you have frozen meatballs on hand, you can use them for your spaghetti, or to make meatball sandwiches. Meatball sandwiches also use spaghetti sauce. Both are good with cheese. You need bread on hand for meatball sandwiches. Bread can also be used for other sandwiches, or for toast, which needs butter and jelly. Butter can also be used to saute the vegetables we mentioned earlier. So you can see that we're assembling a collection of staples that can all work together to make a collection of standard foods.

Do you have hobbies and interests? Find the places you can do those things in the city you want to move to. You can also use that to meet people.

Reddit, Youtube, TikTok, etc. Ive got to say it makes me feel a little better knowing that others out there are suffering like me. Like I'm not alone with this. I have PLENTY of time to reflect back how I got here.\n\nBackground: Im a 40 year old guy. I wasn't always alone but am now. Completely alone, like no family or friends at all. I was born and live in the US. There isn't any family to speak of for me. I wasn't always this way. I had many friends in high school. I think joining the military in my 20s may have been a bad idea tho. There wasnt internet back then or cell phones. Not like today. I was even married at one point for almost a decade. That fell apart for other reasons. \n\nSolutions: Reading alot on reddit its obvious to spot the people who live in other countries trying to comment on solving the problem.  When you live in regions that are population dense, have universal type healthcare, or have many social type activities right outside your door- it can seem like staying inside or alone is a choice. I can tell you here its not. People are spread out across huge areas here. It can take up to an hour before hitting another city. People legit find each other in HS or shortly after graduating from community college. Then they get married and start having kids. Therapy is thrown around a lot. But none of that is FREE here. And IF youre lucky to even find a therapist local. My area doesn't even have them. I don't know what the answer is.\n\nIts a tough age. I think it started to get worse around 33 and has been declining since. People are quick to invite younger 20s to things like church or family events. No one is inviting 40-50 year old people to anything: man or woman. Its like 99% family for social things in the rural countryside. If you have no family then youre fucked.

The cultural landscape is shifting but still you may hear things like \"just be a man\" when life gets difficult. Generally men have only ever been allowed to show one emotions - anger. Trying to go to a friend, especially another man, and crying because life is overwhelming is seen as weak or weird so the ability to connect to others in the world is more difficult for men compared to women.  \n\n\nThe only reason you might see it as \"men now experiencing it as well\" is because only recently have we come far enough as a society to recognize that men also have emotions and they need to be expressed.

A relationship of 5 years that is \"perfect\" is not going to end  over one mistake. Good relationships don't work that way. Unless of course by \"slip up\" you mean: being physically or verbally abusive, cheating, becoming a meth addict, etc. \n\nThe way you're thinking is a defense mechanism. Nobody is obliged to have a relationship with you, or keep you around. That's scary, because rejection and loss hurt. Effort and working on yourself and being the kind of person others want to be around is tiresome. If you don't even try, you can avoid those things. Of course, you'll also be avoiding the positives of relationships, but that's a choice you can make. \n\nSome people are happier being hermits. If that's you, that's fine. You don't even have to make any justification of it. You don't want to put in the effort, you'd rather be alone than do so. That's ok.

The ripple effect of our actions goes far beyond our line of sight. Go out and live this message. Everyone you come in contact with, make their day a little better with kindness, even if it's just a smile, being patient in a long line at the cash register, or helping them with some small things they're struggling with. \n\nAgain, creating extreme scenarios (I can't do anything worthwhile unless I'm rich) is a way to avoid having to take action. \n\n&gt;Are we all just trying to be content with being miserable? \n\nNo. Life is stressful and complicated and sometimes very painful, but it does not have to be a state of constant misery.

There is no definitive or universal answer to this question, as different people and cultures may have different beliefs, values, and purposes that give meaning to their lives. However, some possible ways to approach this question are:\n\n- **Dictionary definition**: According to the OxfordDictionaries\u2077, life is \"the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death\". This definition describes the biological and physical aspects of life, but does not address the psychological, social, or spiritual dimensions that may also be important for some people.\n- **Scientific perspective**: According to Britannica\u2074, life is defined as any system capable of performing functions such as eating, metabolizing, excreting, breathing, moving, growing, reproducing, and responding to external stimuli. This definition is based on observable and measurable criteria that can be applied to various forms of life on Earth and potentially elsewhere in the universe. However, this perspective does not explain why life exists or what its ultimate goal or significance is.\n- **Philosophical inquiry**: According to Wikipedia\u00b2, the meaning of life pertains to the significance of living or existence in general. Many other related questions include: \"Why are we here?\", \"What is life all about?\", or \"What is the purpose of existence?\" There have been many proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history. Some common themes or approaches include: finding happiness, fulfillment, or satisfaction; pursuing one's passions, talents, or interests; contributing to society, humanity, or the greater good; seeking transcendence, enlightenment, or connection with a higher power; creating or discovering one's own meaning or purpose; or accepting the absurdity or mystery of life.\n- **Psychological approach**: According to Psychology Today\u00b3\u2076, the meaning of life is that which we choose to give it. The meaning of life can be derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about, existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the \"how\" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality. An alternative humanistic approach poses the question: \"What is the meaning of my life?\" Researchers who study meaning in life have broken the concept into three facets: coherence (the feeling that life makes sense), purpose (having and working toward goals), and mattering (the sense that one's life has value and makes a difference).\n\nAs you can see, there are many possible ways to explore the meaning of life. Ultimately, it may depend on your personal beliefs, values, experiences, and goals. You may find meaning in one or more of these perspectives or in something else entirely. The important thing is to be open-minded and curious about your own existence and the world around you. I hope this helps you in your quest for understanding. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 9/23/2023\n(1) undefined. http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/.\n(2) https://www.britannica.com/science/life#:~:text=Life%20is%20defined%20as%20any%20system%20capable%20of,moving%2C%20growing%2C%20reproducing%2C%20and%20responding%20to%20external%20stimuli.. https://www.britannica.com/science/life.\n(3) Meaning of life - Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life.\n(4) What Is the Meaning of Life? | Psychology Today. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201803/what-is-the-meaning-life.\n(5) What Makes Life Meaningful? | Psychology Today. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/202008/what-makes-life-meaningful.\n(6) . https://bing.com/search?q=meaning+of+life.\n(7) Life Definition &amp; Meaning | Dictionary.com. https://www.dictionary.com/browse/life.", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "Negative_Surprise_98", "replies": [{"selftext": "Personally I believe it is suffering.

She said if I still felt this way after the first semester was complete, then we\u2019d talk about me moving back.\n\nThe weeks went by, I went to class, did my homework, ate alone in the dining hall. My roommate never left the room so I started to. I\u2019d take my laptop, phone, and chargers out to the shared common area on our floor and sat down. Slowly, little by little, some of the others on the floor came out too. Someone brought a tv out. Another would bring out a deck of cards. We\u2019d talk about tv shows, movies, games, classes. The sophomores would tell funny stories from the year before and give us freshmen advice on things around campus.\n\nIt got better. Hanging out in that common area, just willing to talk to everyone else gave me so many friends. We started going out to dinner. We\u2019d do homework together. Go to the movie theater.

It is easy to sum it up to it being natural, but for a moment, just think, why am I attracted to men or women? And this is the conclusion I came to.\n\nWomen are very beautiful. You can see it in how they express themselves, be it in how they dress, their hair, the work, and the efforts and lengths they go to just to look attractive. I appreciate the effort and the feminine aura they have. Additionally, when a woman cares for you, they will go out of their way to ensure you are taken care of and are very caring even with all the questions they ask. I also appreciate a chatty woman who has stories, and I promise to listen to most of them and always take your side. Moreover, I am of the opinion that a woman can follow you to the ends of the earth if you have a vision and offer a sense of security. They are not complicated if you get them on your program and lead. This is not all but a summary.\n\nSo why are you attracted to women?

We can all be big, dangerous brutes in one way or another, but I get really into guys who direct and control that energy really well.\n\nGood bodies are often an indicator of that behavior, but they aren't necessary for me. Men can compensate in interesting ways, too, since we often lack the universally agreed upon aesthetic beauty of women's bodies. \n\nThere's lots to like about men and women, people are so beautiful!", "ups": 3, "depth": 1, "author": "FartFignugey", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "I'm sexually attracted to men, but I appreciate the beauty of other women.

But I can still look at those men and appreciate the hard work and sacrifices that have gone into making that physique happen, and I can acknowledge there's beauty in it, they just don't 'turn me on'. Same with a range of other dudes- I can honestly say 'you are an attractive person' without feeling any urge to take them to bed.\n\nAnd I feel exactly the same admiring other women. The 'spark' or 'flutter' or 'wet panties,' whatever you want to call it isn't there. I've never met a woman I want to take to bed. But I sure as sh!t have looked at a lot of women of all sorts of looks and bodies and thought 'honey, you're gorgeous'.  And I've enjoyed looking at that beauty, just not in a horny way.\n\nI also like nudes and classical artwork. There's both a lot of nude art focusing on women, because of the curve thing, and a lot focusing on the big muscle guys, again because those muscles make a fascinating art subject. And the art and the bodies that helped create it are undeniably aesthetically beautiful. They just don't flick my bang switch.\n\nI really wish there was more focus on the fact that these two things are completely different. Acknowledging aesthetic beauty /=/ wanting to screw it. Women do get more leeway to say this- I don't know many women afraid to tell someone they look gorgeous when they do. But guys, especially, get hammered with the idea that saying something is attractive = I must want to bed it, and that's so sad. There's a lot of beauty in the world.

Plenty of ladies will have shorter than 'average' length up there. There's someone for everyone\n2. Two, while some may get off on the squick of pain from having their cervix repeatedly nailed, for most of us it just isn't fun or pleasant in ANY way. Average or smaller is often a better fit than long dudes. For real.\n3. Third, they ain't lying when they say girth feels better than length for most women anyway.\n4. Four, sex is really a place where it isn't what you have, but how you use it.\n5. Five- may I introduce you to the meme from a poster who gets sad for the girlfriends of the dudes when she (a presumed lesbian) hears guys ask, 'But how do you have sex as 2 women?' If you really think good sex= putting a prick in and out a hole few times, then Lords help the ladies you're tryna bed. That just ain't good sex.\n\nHave some anecdotal TMI to seal the deal. Don't say y'all weren't warned about TMI lol\n\n&gt;!I'm a pretty tall woman. Not 6 foot, but only just. So while I confess I have never stuck a tape measure in the first hole where the sun don't shine down there, I assume I'm going to be at least average sized down there if not maybe just above average in length cos I'm over-average in height and long in the torso. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I've had an amazing partner who was very sub-average in cock length. Not a micro peen, but very noticeably short and stubby. Definitely one of my best still. Dude understood how to do sex right with the cock doggie AND the other bits (hello fingers? tongue? Other things? Even hetero sex ain't just a tab A slot B thing). And NOT being of a length where cock and cervix automatically met was nice. Dude could go to pound town as he liked without any risk of pain and bringing a lot of pleasure. That's an A class sex partner right there. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I also have had an above length dude, and half the fun of sexy time goes away when you're both having to dance the ouchie dance to make sure nothing hurts in unfun ways. F\\*cker actually bent my IUD strings up completely, lol, leading to an interesting conversation with my gynae too. And no doubt with his Dick Doc too, cos he got poked bad in the process with it! Those things ain't just string. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I've a well endowed male friend who has that issue constantly too. Doesn't help his girl is teeny either. It takes something away when you have to be careful how deep you're plunging the depths to not hurt your partner with it.!&lt;\n\nTLDR? Cock length REALLY ain't all that in bed. 'Girls don't like small guys' means either you've spoken to one woman who has specific preferences (which is cool, but not universal) or an excuse to not learn how to sex better with what you got. If someone tells you the sex is bad, learn to sex better. Don't go 'women don't like shorter cocks' and assume that lets you off the hook.

{"post": {"title": "Looking for new mods for anime_irl!", "subreddit": "anime_irl", "selftext": "It's been a minute since we've had new mods on this subreddit, and as it stands, it has become more apparent to us (and I'm sure to you users out there) that we've been slacking on our jobs.\n\nOur last addition to a mod was nearly five years ago, and most of our mod team has been in service for 7+ years.\n\nDuring those days and a few years after, we tried to be diligent with our work here.\n\nBut as all things with time, we got worn out, burned out, don't have the time we used to, or our passion is not as strong as it used to be.\n\nI reminance about the old days, and try to come here to rekindle that feeling long lost, but each time faltering.\n\nMost of us got hired because of of our reputation and contribution to the /r/anime_irl community. However, due to our lack of interactions with the community, volunteer process might be different than it was all those years ago.\n\nBefore it was just name and status that was enough to get you on the mod team here, but seeing as how the current mods (myself inlcuded) aren't on here as often, we'll be looking through your profile personally as you put your name down. Go through your history, posts, comments, etc.\n\nOf course, I encourage you not to delete anything that you would see demeaning on your resume, as that's just who you are. This isn't a real job, I wouldn't worry about actually getting it or otherwise.\n\nThat being said, the tasks are reletively easy, and can be done by just going through the front page of anime_irl or going through mod-queue and deeming what deserves to stay and what does not. Modding takes perhaps no more than a few minutes of your time.\n\n##*\"If it's so easy and takes so little time, why can't the current mods do it?\"*\n\nWell, despite the time it takes, it's throughout the day. Sure, five minutes to go through the queue, but it's five minutes every hour or so, and our consistentcy is our vice.\n\nThat being all said, we're probably not going to add all that many people, perhaps a handful of people with extra time on their hands and people that like the subreddit enough to want to see it in a better place than it currently is.\n\nThanks,\n\n*The anime_irl mod team*", "ups": 13, "permalink": "/r/anime_irl/comments/16icdde/looking_for_new_mods_for_anime_irl/", "num_comments": 16}, "replies": [{"selftext": "if there are new mods I also feel like they should try and be a little more strict\n\nmaybe it's just me but I kinda don't want to see pages taken out of hentai even if they have no nudity, there is already hentai_irl for that kind of stuff\n\nalso there are tons of unrelatable posts that belong in to other subs\n\nanyway I could help mod the sub, even if I'm not actually active in the comments in this sub I do tend to always check  and I'm pretty active on reddit overall", "ups": 9, "depth": 0, "author": "salasy", "replies": [{"selftext": "I agree, seems like NSFW posts are a lot more rampant, and that overall is the most notable thing.\n\nI'll keep you in mind when the decision is made.", "ups": 3, "depth": 1, "author": "ShakuSwag", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "This of course, is all spectulation on my end.\n\nI don't know if the quality of this subreddit has actually dropped all that much, I just know I've noticed a lot more in the moderation queue that go unanswered throughout the day.", "ups": 5, "depth": 0, "author": "ShakuSwag", "replies": [{"selftext": "&gt;I don't know if the quality of this subreddit has actually dropped all that much\n\nin the last period I kinda started to notice a lot of unrelatable content and also a lot of content taken out of hentai\n\nnothing really too much nsfw or with nudity, but it still kinda feels like stuff that could easily go in to hentai_rl\n\nI'm not saying that all content from hentai should go, but a lot of them is also very much unrelatable and in my opinion not really  with the sub spirit", "ups": 6, "depth": 1, "author": "salasy", "replies": [{"selftext": "Agreed.

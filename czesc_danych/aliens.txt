Why not just use an unbroken bone instead of going through the hassle of adding a copper smith? Although bird-like, I have also seen no explanation where the collar bone originated from. Certainly, at that altitude and climate, there cannot be very many avian species in the area with a bone of that size to compare. If it is a fabrication, where then did that bone originate?

(It would be nice to have the real DICOM scan files instead of these videos, so if anyone has them definitely post a link.)  \nI only looked at the 'Josefina' scans as the other scans seem to be obviously human children remains that have had their fingers and toes cut off to to leave only 3.\n\n  \nI noted some interesting things in the scan, for example:\n\n1. There does seem to be an opening in the pelvis for excretion and possibly the birth for those 'eggs'.\n\nAt the same time:\n\n1.  There doesn't seem to be a socket for those large femurs in the pelvis... as if this thing could never walk.\n2.  The shoulders seem to connect to the back of the scapula instead of the front like every animal I know of which is very strange.  One could say 'it is because it is an alien' but anatomically I don't see how it makes any functional sense for a bone to cross through the body like that (a more likely explanation imo is that they were put on backwards from some other creature).\n3. Forensic pathologist Dr. Benitez in the talk said the creature had appropriate tendons and other anatomical features in the hands and elsewhere that make it impossible to fake. I personally don't know how he can make out anything of that kind from the scans that I linked above, but it is possible he used different scans (in which case I am not sure why they would publish lower resolution ones, since it is just a video instead of actual DICOM data and doing so would not serve any clear purpose)\n4. The ribcage goes all the way down to the pelvis, and is very dense with articulations.  Maybe 'alien' but it would also mean the creature could not bend forward very much or at all, and in addition obviating the need for such an articulated spine.  There is a reason you don't have ribs over your guts... so you can bend over.  This creature could not do that.  The closest thing I can think to this part of the anatomy is a snake or fish, but those creatures leave the front of the rib cage open, so they do offer protection to internal organs but also still allow the creature to bend.  The ribs in this creature seem like they could also pinch it's internal organs when bending??... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n5. The ribcage also does not protect what is presumably a most important area just under the head and neck, instead replaced by a copper metal \"bikini\".  This is strange, maybe alien, but doesn't seem to serve any purpose or make any anatomical sense.  Maybe the purpose would be to allow articulation there, but then you have the scapulas and other structures on it's back that would not seem to allow bending there anyway.  In short, this upper chest area does not seem to be part of any creature that could be alive and moving about, but what do I know.\n6. I can't help but shake the obvious look of the 'alien' bodies as someone's clay sculpt.  The bodies simply look like they were sculpted by a person with poor anatomical knowledge and simple sculpting tools (yes ultimately sculpted with animal parts instead of clay, but still sculpted)\n\nMy take is this whole thing seems fairly clearly a hoax.

In a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Republican lawmakers request a staff-level briefing to acquire additional information on the DOD\u2019s failed audit, financial management practices generally, and what it is doing to implement outstanding recommendations for improvement.\n\n\u201cThe Committee on Oversight and Accountability is investigating the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) failure to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.

In January 2023, GAO reported that DOD failed to accurately account for much government furnished property provided to contractors including weapons, equipment, technology, and other defense articles. DOD last estimated in 2014 that contractors were in possession of $220 billion in government furnished property but GAO says that estimate is \u201csignificantly understated.\u201d GAO has also recommended several changes to DOD weapons systems acquisition, business systems modernization, and overall financial tracking.\n\n\u201cDOD\u2019s lax financial management and inability to adequately track weapons, equipment and other defense articles have raised serious concerns about DOD\u2019s stewardship of taxpayer dollars, especially as DOD\u2019s budget approaches thirteen figures.

They claimed to have been abducted by extraterrestrial beings in 1961 and described the beings as having large heads and eyes, which could be seen as an early description of what later became known as \"Grey aliens.\"\n\n&gt;Additionally, the famous 1977 book \"Communion\" by Whitley Strieber also popularized the image of Grey aliens.

Here\u2019s the weird part. There were fighter jets circling it and my house! It\u2019s not uncommon to see fighter jets as I live by an airport and have a military base in my city. The jets were extremely loud!! An flying low and circling, which I have never seen before. I have never seen one go so fast. The fighter jets were grey and white camo.  But the floating object was quiet and completely black. It didn\u2019t have that high pitched noise you usually hear with drones. It was probably about 3 houses down from me. I thought someone was parachuting from the jets at first but it didn\u2019t have a big enough \u201cparachute\u201d I thought maybe military training but why would they train in my suburb? I was outside with my kids they were swinging I had an errie feeling with the jets circling so close I didn\u2019t point out the floating object to my kids because theyre very young I just tried to shoo them into the house. My husband heard the jets and came outside but after the thing floated off. I looked on the next door app and other people posted about the noise from the jets.

My mind went back to Signs, I think I was trying to catch and hints of an upcoming \u201ctwist\u201d.  The things that felt off that left me questioning:\n\n* Aliens seemed to be trying to talk with her, from the weird little hand signs by the spider gray, to the obvious trying to talk to her by the regular gray in the house.  Even the little gray was using hand signals - this was never explained and still has me confused.  \n\n* They seem to be toying with her, they have the power to entirely control the situation - I.e the scissors scene where the gray knows what\u2019s going on with his back turned.  But seem more curious about her than anything.  Kind of like they are surprised she\u2019s fighting them and not just accepting her fate?  They go through periods of intense chase into lackadaisical curiosity and it\u2019s very strange.\n\n* My take is that obviously the parasite creatures are the overlords in this and that the grays are doing their bidding.  The disappointment on the gray\u2019s face when she pulls the parasite out of her throat and misses the beam of light from the ship\u2026he was like \u201cshit\u2026I\u2019m gonna catch hell for this\u201d \ud83d\ude02.

If this came our way, guess what, there\u2019d be a lot of weird shit we\u2019d never be able to understand.  Same thing here, who are we to think we would comprehend their goals and why they are doing what they are doing anymore than ants would know why we\u2019re exterminating their colony.\n\nI personally hate it when the villain does a monologue and I think any explanation to her - a relative nobody - would have cheapened the experience.\n\nIn the end, I think I like it more than Signs - which sticks with me to this day despite its flaws.

Most of the key components of beneficial adaptations are thought to begin as random mutations conserved by drift; which basically means, if you don't use it, you won't necessarily lose it. \n\nThink about webbed digits. Webbed digits are fairly rare in humans, because they don't give individuals or populations an advantage when it comes to producing healthy offspring. If anything, they've probably been a bit of a disadvantage in the past as far as sexual selection goes (though this has changed in modern times, now that surgical options are available, meaning that the gene probably won't go away anytime soon).\n\nBut we have to consider the fact that bats, all bats, must descend from populations that were born with webbed digits, at a time when they would've also provided *no* advantage. Therefore, we must conclude that these populations had some other reproductive advantages that allowed their genes to be the most prolific. This would allow for the trait of webbed digits to spread in all populations for no real reason; that's what we call \"drift\" (it also works the other way, when traits are *lost* for no real reason). Eventually, webbed digits became useful to the ancestors of bats, likely for a purpose such as catching flying insects, before eventually being used to glide, and then, still later, to fly.\n\nThis is why the structure of our bodies is unlikely to be repeated on other planets; it's very specifically evolved to reflect our very specific genetic history.

Stephen Hawking was an important influence on much of our current understanding of the universe. Therefore, an alien race that had never encountered humans before might conclude that all major astrophysicists are like Stephen Hawking; that their minds develop exponentially and inverse to their physical capabilities.

Although I\u2019d expect the finer details of their physiology to be different (like metabolism, micro-anatomical features, the exact way their genetics work etc.) I\u2019d fully expect that they share similarities in gross anatomy (large features of anatomy). \n\nAnimals in similar niches have similar body plans. Form fits function. A technological species needs to meet a few requirements:\n\n1) They need to be able to manipulate objects precisely. They need a body plan that allows some appendages to be free to hold things. \n2) They need high intelligence. \n3) They need some sort of reason to develop intelligence, technology and culture in the first place. Intelligence is fairly costly because it requires a lot of energy and time for these things to develop. \n4) They need to be social because technology requires culture for knowledge to be passed down and a wide variety of skills and materials. \n5) Probably a good sense of sight and most likely binocular vision for depth perception (more eyes than two are possible, but evolution tends to whittle away redundancy as discussed later). \n6) they need to be terrestrial because technology requires extraction of materials that can\u2019t be done under water. This puts a lot of limitations on what sort of body form they have: they likely have a rigid skeleton, dehydration resistant skin. \n7) They need to have an energy efficient form of locomotion to make up for having a costly brain. \n8) They probably won\u2019t have great physical prowess (be super strong, super fast, have amazing weapons like teeth and claws)because if they did it reduces the need to rely on intelligence. \n9) They will probably be generalists: eat a wide variety of food and live in a wide range of habitats. This would be a good reason to develop intelligence along with being social. \n10) it will have as few limbs as it can survive with while still being efficient at moving and making tools. Evolution has a tendency get rid of redundant limbs and organs as demonstrated by snakes, legless lizards, marine mammals, caecilians (a worm like amphibian). This requirement on its own makes being humanoid quite a likely body form because to manipulate objects you need at least two manipulating appendages (like hands) and at least two limbs for moving. Any less limbs than that and they either have difficulty manipulating objects with precision or difficulty moving. Any more limbs than that and are likely wasting energy on redundant limbs or inhabiting a different niche. \n\n11) Bilateral symmetry and cephalisation. Bilateral symmetry is not only probably an advantage for locomotion but probably made like at a more fundamental level by how body plans are laid out through diffusion of morphogens. Only the simplest of multicellular animals tend to be irregular in shape and those tend to be sessile. Cephalisation means having a head. Evolutionarily it makes sense to have your main sensory organs near your mouth end and your brain. \n\nThere might be other body plans possible, but I think something resembling humanoid is highly likely.  Keep in mind there could be many body plans for intelligent creatures but being intelligent AND technological puts a number of limitations on body plans. Marine mammals might be very intelligent but their environment and lack of manipulating appendages make development of high technology almost impossible. Octopuses a very intelligent and are quite good at manipulating things, but their body plan isn\u2019t suitable for a terrestrial environment. \n\nIt\u2019s worth considering that life any where in the universe while it will undoubtedly be very different in the fine details and exact history of evolution will probably have some similarities based on fundamental aspects of physics and chemistry. Life will probably develop in a liquid environment because it\u2019s more conductive to chemistry. Due to this pretty much all groups of terrestrial species will evolve from species that originally lived in a liquid environment. Efficient swimmers tend to be fish shaped (fish, ichtyosaurs, dolphins) so terrestrial animals will tend to pass through a bottleneck of similar body forms on the way to be being terrestrial. Of course the first Terrestrial animals on our planet were arthropods (insects, arachnids and crustaceans) but none of them have body plans that fit the requirements above but suppose they could technically evolve a more suitable body plan (perhaps that explains insectoids).\n\nEDIT: actually exoskeletons are not very likely since they don\u2019t scale up well. However they might have osteoderms (bone plates in the skin) that make them look like they have exoskeletons.

Mexican Mummies]", "subreddit": "aliens", "selftext": "Ok, firstly let me be clear that I'm not exactly convinced these things are legitimate. I like thinking about stuff like this, and creating logical pathways to whatever could be consider a realistic reason these things exist or would have existed as biological entities, knowing what we know about them from both sides of the \"are they real or not\" spectrum. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* There's a lot of other things that look a lot like these things presented in other places. The Russian one with a body in the snow, tons of ancient statues and carvings that resemble them, from myriad cultures, etc. \n* There is some decent evidence, that I cannot verify on my own at all, that these things are real and organic, and that they were not assembled in the sense that they were sewed together out of a mishmash of random parts. \n* There is also some compelling evidence that the parts they are made up of, are indeed somewhat of a mishmash of random parts, some of the things do not seem to match, or are facing the wrong direction, nor do they seem like they would be a very good vehicle for locomotion as we understand it from our own earth-life perspective.\n* Again from evidence that from my layman's perspective amounts to hearsay, there does seem to be some evidence that these things are very, very old. Far older than most of humanities understanding of anatomy to even have the knowledge or desire to construct a fake to such a degree.\n* They contain as of yet unidentified inorganic parts, as well as what appear to be eggs of some kind.\n\nHere are some other things that don't really have much to do with the mummies themselves;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Interstellar travel is pretty complicated and any way you slice it, it's not something that's going to be easy for any organic entity (as we understand it) to endure. \n* Livestock mutilation has been recorded for centuries in relation with unknown areal phenomena. \n* Our history and understanding of DNA and genetic manipulation is, in the scheme of things, in its very, very early infancy. \n\nOk so mix it all together. Big 'What if':\n\nYou're an alien civilization of some kind. Instead of sending actual alien astronauts to visit and collect information, or completely inorganic drones, you send small factories. These small factories zoop around the destination planet, collect organic material from local species, and sort of \"3D Print\" an organic worker drone that is, more or less, equipped for the environment of that world.\n\nYou cut out the backside of a goat's skull because it's a great shape for sticking all the required head-parts in. You snatch up some random vertebrae, whatever long bones will work, mash em up in a little skin bag in a shape that loosely resembles whatever successful shape the planet in question has produced, you attach some little cybernetic parts to make sure its rabbit heart and duck kidneys work together, and have that thing perform whatever tasks it is now specifically designed to do. It can even create more versions of itself. You can send your little UFO/UAP factory all over the world snatching up creatures and re-creating them into little organic drones. The planet has limited resources for building inorganic things, but abundant organic life. Every once in a while a farmer notices they took a cow, but hardly do we ever notice a few deer, squirrels, parrots, monkeys, etc.\n\nIt sort of answers all the questions about why these things are like they are. Yes they are made out of a bunch of random pieces, but that's how they were made, organically, as a living entity.

Some of the most celebrated scientists in history are the ones who bucked the prevailing consensus and made world-changing discoveries. But science requires credible evidence and a systematic approach to study any subject. The challenge with UAPs lies in the scarcity of conclusive and reproducible evidence that meets scientific standards.\n\nFraudulent evidence, hoaxes, and misidentifications have plagued UAP investigations for decades. These instances have understandably led to skepticism within the scientific community. When a field is marred by unreliable or dubious claims, it becomes challenging to establish a scientific foundation.\n\nThe goal, as you say, should be to encourage rigorous scientific study of UAPs. But for that to happen, the issues of credibility and evidence quality need to be addressed. Encouraging scientists to engage with UAP research necessitates a concerted effort to sift through the genuine reports, discard the fraudulent ones, and promote transparency in data collection and analysis.\n\nMoreover, the stigma associated with UAPs isn't solely a result of fraudulent evidence.

So three women go for a walk alone, one dies from cut wounds. Two return. You know what would happen today? \u201cOh so you two obviously killed your fucking friend.\u201d Why the lapse of logic when it happened in the past?\n\nThere\u2019s another historical account from the high Middle Ages of a \u201cwerewolf\u201d stalking a village and killing people. No one ever saw it though, all they saw was the victims. Obviously, this was a serial killer hundreds of years before people even knew the concept of a serial killer. There are a lot of accounts like this throughout history.\n\nBut for some stupid ass reason, when it happens in ancient times people say \u201coh must be elves/demons/aliens or some shit, there\u2019s no other explanation!\u201d, but when it happens in Victorian London it\u2019s obviously a deranged psychopath. So why do we have this tendency to romanticize and exaggerate more distant historical accounts of the same thing we see happening today? People murder people. Sometimes, *women* murder people too. Gasp! The scandal! Unimaginable! \n\nI think the answer to that question is fairly obvious, or it should be, and it underscores a major problem I have with Jacques Vallee\u2019s work as an aside: it is riddled with modern confirmation bias and lapses in logic.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean to rag on us modern folks too much, because these people in the past were equally biased in a different way. In the case of women murderers, they were often biased because they *seriously didn\u2019t think a woman could kill*. I mean how could she? An upstanding godfearing woman like her? And with such weak arms too? How absurd. She doesn\u2019t have the upper arm strength. Or the smarts to plan and get away with a murder. I mean the most she can plan for is what to cook for dinner. Wouldn\u2019t want to give herself a headache now. Murder is a man\u2019s sport after all. So must be a demon or werewolf or some shit. \n\nThere are literally historical accounts where *obvious suspects were deliberately ignored because they were women.* Sexism was pervasive until relatively recent times, to be honest, which should be shameful as fuck because we like to consider ourselves enlightened today.\n\nSo, forgive me but three women walking in the woods at night and one dies with cuts on her abdomen?

I was thinking some type of perceptual hash is applied a video and then an encryption key that can be attached to the hash so that the video can be proven authentic by the device maker. So long as the device maker's private keys are never leaked, something like this might work.\n\nIn fact, this could be a great money-making venture for a business to provide this type of service. An app that scans your photos (with proper permissions from the owner of course) and the photos get digitally signed by the app provider. Then the EXIF data would have this digital signature added so that the photo is forever verified as authentic. There are a lot of ways this could be done but my first thought for the easiest is grabbing a new photo taken and immediately signing it before it can be altered in some way.", "ups": 66, "permalink": "/r/aliens/comments/16oj6dl/do_you_think_video_evidence_is_fundamentally/", "num_comments": 51}, "replies": [{"selftext": "__Reminder__: Read the rules and understand the subreddit topic(s) listed in the sidebar before posting or commenting.

That  a service for certifying media authenticity by incorporating signatures of surrounding context and point of capture info..etc  is probably something we are going to need for anyone trying to document something.\n\nI'm sure that , just like other DRM protections, there could be hacks to falsify the content. But the certifying authority could at least attest that the footage has not been modified since it was received. If the position of any Sun, Moon Stars..etc corroborate  the date and time, with very small room for modification of the stream before submission , then that at least lends credibility.  You could have a  high speed  AI stream editor overlay something into the feed on the fly , but it doesn't give you time to review what the AI did and make sure it all checks out and is consistent.\n\nThe problem is,  you need people to be aware of and have a desire to use the service. Researchers, investigators and documentary producers may be willing to pay for such a service, and take the time to actually submit their footage to it. But they don't represent the majority of the eyes on the field.\n\nOther users could submit  after the fact, after they capture something, to certify it from that point forward, but if it's not uploaded within a few milliseconds then there is risk of contamination, and so the value is less. Still the sooner they upload and certify the better. There is I think some value to it.\n\nThat said, even now, some of that data is available to us in the from of the context in which the video is recorded and how it is sourced. You can still get a lot about the credibility of the footage based on the research time and attention to detail.\n\nFor example if someone captures a UFO and it's waving around in the air, it's fake.  CGI or Drone doesn't really matter, that's not how they move.\n\nThere's also a difference between \"quick\" acceleration and \"instant\" acceleration. Genuine NHI craft do the latter.\n\nWhat about occlusion and atmospheric haze or noise. Does that match the apparent depth of the object?\n\nIf the  UFO moves do they appear to anticipate the move and follow it perfectly?\n\nWhat about reactions of the people involved. Do they appear genuine?\n\nIs lighting, reflection shadows accurate?\n\nA lot of this can of course be faked, but it becomes exponentially harder to mark all the boxes without significant time investment.

What is the spinal canal? There are some things that draw attention, like the ribs, for example, the ribs that are there, like that image we have there. There, the ribs are inside the spinal canal. That draws a lot of attention, which could be once But we are not saying that what it is about, simply seeing what we are seeing, the way it is in the ribs, the circular shape, I don't see a sternum, I don't see that it has any part for cartilage, I don't know if it catches my attention.

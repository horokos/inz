I actually just got home from the date about an hour ago and it was magical to say the least. We went and got some food at a local Mexican restaurant and just sat their talking for probably 2 hours about any and everything. We went for a walk at one of our towns local events afterwards and we didn't even have a path where we were going because we were just talking the entire time and getting lost in real life and in conversation. I didn't want to take her home afterwards so I used the lame excuse to get ice cream and same thing, we sat there just talking and learning about each other. We were connecting on so many things and my ex wife never talked to me like Kay did tonight, even when me and my ex-wife started dating, we never did this. I went to take Kay home and again she just sat in my truck as we were parked in her driveway and just talked again for what felt like forever. I finally had to tell her that she needed to go inside because she was getting sleepy so I walked her to her door and I was being a gentleman because I didn't want to take advantage of a woman who was exhausted so I just told her I had a great time and I hope she did too. I went to head back to my truck and she stopped me, pulled me in, and kissed me for what felt like forever. It was one hell of a kiss. I left afterwards and I had a text from her before I made it home wondering when our next date was.\n\nI understand why my ex-wife was jealous 3 years ago because there is definitely something between us. Something I was blind to because I was married, but I should have left my cheating ex wife sooner. Oh well, it seems like me and Kay are together now so that's all that matters.

I don't think the world really needs reddit... \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nFirstly, thank you for sharing your situation. Relationships are complex, and there's often more to them than just one issue. Here are some observations and thoughts based on what you've shared:\n\nPrioritization of Money: While it's great to treat a partner and make them feel special, it's crucial to differentiate between love and monetary gestures. The essence of any strong relationship lies in understanding, trust, and emotional intimacy, not solely on financial transactions.\n\nCommunication: It seems like there's a disconnect in how both of you view money and its role in the relationship. Open and honest communication is essential. Share your goals and plans for the future, both personal and financial, and ask her to do the same. Understanding each other's perspectives can potentially bridge the gap.\n\nPersonal Finances: Building wealth, especially at a young age, can have long-term benefits. Financial stability provides security, not just for you, but for potential future family endeavors as well. Having aspirations to secure your financial future is not wrong.\n\nComparisons to Past Relationships: It's concerning that she's comparing your financial gestures to her past boyfriends. Every relationship is unique, and comparing them can be detrimental. Her needs and wants should be discussed within the context of your current relationship, not past ones.\n\nAvailability: Her choosing not to see you and using work as a reason because you're not spending enough is concerning. A relationship should not be transactional in nature. Emotional and physical presence is crucial for maintaining intimacy.\n\nTrust: Her being constantly MIA and not responding can be a red flag in terms of trust and communication. A partner should be accessible and willing to communicate, even if they're busy.\n\nUltimately, while you love her, it's essential to reflect on whether this relationship is beneficial for both parties. Consider seeking relationship counseling or therapy, where a neutral third party can provide insights and strategies to help navigate these challenges.\n\nRemember, both partners in a relationship should contribute and compromise to make it work.

{"post": {"title": "Am I wrong for thinking it's weird that my bf's family expects me to pay for their dogs surgery", "subreddit": "amiwrong", "selftext": "To keep it fairly short, I (18f) and my bf (18m) both still live with our parents. Generally when we hang out we go to his moms house, I really like his family and all, his family seems to really like me, and I've stayed the night a few times. They got this little chihuahua puppy fairly recently and I love dogs, but I immediately really loved this dog so much. So since pretty much they got it he kept joking about how it was my dog or whatever but not fr really. And the other day I was at Walmart and I saw these family costume pjs and they had pet pjs too so obviously I had to get one for me my bf and the pup. And when I went over there and we put the dog in the costume, his mom immediately was like this is amazing. And then because it was like a family costume she then decided he was our son, and I accepted obviously, and then she made a joke about how she's gonna need the money to get him fixed soon. And that was that I thought. And that was a few weeks ago, and then yesterday I went back over there and idk where the dog was but he wasn't anywhere near or anything so it's not like seeing him reminded her but after a bit she said something like \"oh that surgery is going to cost about $50\" and I just said \"oh um ok\" and she didn't ask me to give her money now, so I'm not entirely sure she wasn't joking, but also it came out of nowhere we weren't talking about the dog, and he wasn't in the room so if it was still a joke it was a weird time to make the joke and she sounded serious. Basically what I'm asking is, that's weird right? For me to help pay for this dogs surgery if it isn't actually mine, and I don't even come over enough for it to sortof be mine. I mean my bf and is family are not well off by any means, neither am I or my family but I would say we are low to mid in the middle class, and him and his family are probably mid to high lower class. And because I still live with my mom, and have a decently paying job, I definetly could pay the surgery no problem, and if they are actually asking me to I'm going to because whatever. But I still think it's a bit weird. And idk about his mom but my bf is definitely not the type to ask for money. He is (almost) annoyingly independent, there are times I wish he would just let me help him out and if he really wants he can pay me back, but in the almost year and a half we've been dating I've only given him $20 and thats because I didn't really give him and option and he really needed gas.

My father died 7 years ago and my mom exactly 1 year ago. I started school this august I was nervous since it was a new school. I felt like crying and got to the nurses . They looked at me asking why I was there . I told them my name and told them why I was there . I went to the main nurses office to speak with them. I told them my situation and since I didn\u2019t have any documents atm , that if they could look me up . Then the nurses face lit up , she looked at me ,and said out loud . \u201c OH I REMEMBER YOU , ( blank) TOLD ME ABOUT YOU! YOUR THE GIRL WHOS MOM DIED!\u201d She said outloud making me sick to my stomach. The bit of confidence I had was gone. After school I went to pick up my glucose meter . She told me that since my mom had died my brother had to do paperwork. I nodded and thought why couldn\u2019t she say \u201c I need your brother to do paperwork \u201c. Instead of mentioning my mom. That day I went home crying . Two weeks later, I felt awful I had chest pain and felt like I couldn\u2019t breath. I went to the nurses and told them and my sugar was 261. If my sugar is over 250 and I don\u2019t feel well , protocol is to call my parents / legal guardian. She said in a mocky tone \u201c well I\u2019m not sending you home , if your brother wants to pick you up he can !\u201d I called my brother and told him o wanted to go to the ER immediately. That\u2019s when mrs nurse told the other nurse to check my vitals. She went to ask me why I wanted to go to the ER. I told her I felt awful. I ended up having a infection in my urine. That was affecting my kidneys causing pain. This Friday I felt awful . My head hurt , I was dizzy , very sweaty, and couldn\u2019t talk straight. My sugar was 155 , 225 ,250 and lastly 296. I was supposed to be sent home immediately. She gave me a grin and sent me to class saying \u201c you got insulin 1 hour ago your fine\u201d. I had gotten 1.3 u of insulin . I told my brother through text all upset. My sugar went down 2 hours later. I still felt awful and finally went home at 5pm. I feel like she hates me. She only helps kids she likes. I\u2019ve told my brother I want to switch schools but he\u2019s always busy with school and work. My therapist said to wait a few more months. If I wait this women will probably kill me. My school LPC said she would talk to the nurse. I don\u2019t think much will happen. I saw my other school nurse that day and I hugged her and felt like crying. After all this am I wrong for wanting to leave this school? Sorry for all the  grammar errors.\n\n / more info :\nI\u2019m from the US to be more clearly . I\u2019m writing down all she has done. I\u2019m a insulin pump user and I also use a CGM. I\u2019m planning to do a case against her inside the school . She clearly does not care. Thank you for the amazing responses I hope to see more ideas. Im thinking of looking for online schools. Since I saw a comment say \u201c if I change school and there worse over there\u201d and I agree. Ty\n\nI am sick atm I have a infection and I have severe anxiety. That\u2019s another reason I\u2019ve had high levels. I do have a diabetic plan and in my school I should have a 504 plan.

He has also caused over $1,000 worth in property damage. The father has a lot of narcissistic and manipulative tendencies. \n\nI left the state and got an emergency job transfer due to domestic abuse and him damaging my property. i am in a protective program within my job where no one can find out which office I work at or where I live. I got the transfer because although I\u2019ve never pressed charges, I did let them know at the hospital that I was assaulted but I didn\u2019t tell them by who. The medical documentation aligns with my text messages with him for that night correspond to verify that he was the cause of the concussion that caused me to miscarry two days later. I also worry for my child\u2019s safe due to his history of being SA\u2019d as a child by family members and not realizing it doesn\u2019t just go away, then telling me he\u2019s ok with these same people watching the baby. He\u2019s very fragmented unfortunately\u2026 I feel so bad for giving my child this man as a father, but don\u2019t regret my child at all.\n\nAnyway\u2026He was paying me back (very slowly) only after I left, for the medical bills ($1,200) of causing me a concussion and the car damage (only gave me $750 towards anything at all after almost a year). He says he\u2019s trying to get a car and has his own bills ($300 credit card payment &amp; a phone bill)\u2026. And that I\u2019m being inconsiderate\u2026. I won\u2019t even go into how flawed this whole situation is in its entirety. \n\nHe does not know exactly where I am but has an idea because he knows where my family is from (across the country). Now that I sent paperwork for mediation after I got advice from legal aid, and told him I would like physical and legal custody after birth. This conversation (through email) escalated where he sent vague threats, tried to contact my dad (bc he thinks I don\u2019t talk to him) and said he did it basically to get him to \u201ctalk to me so things can get better\u201d and get advice since none of my other family will talk to him. My dad told me he told him he contacted him to \u201ctell his side\u201d and ask for advice. My dad told him be a man and stop involving others, talk to me directly &amp; that he\u2019s for the best interest of his daughter and grandchild.\n\nAt this point I waited hours for him to contact me and he didn\u2019t after I sent that initial email about the mediation. I told him I know he contacted my dad, that\u2019s when he started the threats and saying my dad was \u201cmessy.\u201d After all of this I just said I offered mediation and tried my best. I said he needs to leave me alone and he needs to leave my child alone. I\u2019m 7 months pregnant. \n\nHe stopped paying completely a few weeks ago (normally sends about $100 when he gets paid each week). I\u2019m no longer concerned with payments or anything else, just our safety. \n\nHe used to talk about gang affiliation and I have a picture of him doing a gang sign. I brought this up before (after I left the state but still before these events) and now he says he\u2019s a \u201ccivilian\u201d and not affiliated although the used to do the hand sign all the time and send emojis that are associated with that gang. \n\nI have so many reasons I don\u2019t want my child to know this man at all\u2026 and that makes me so sad that I\u2019d do this to a child but all I can do going forward is better\u2026 I just want my baby to have a good life. \n\nI have a meeting with a lawyer this week for advice on going forward. \n\nBut I am contemplating two options: doing things the \u201cright\u201d way, attempting to get a protective order in my new, current state against him asap, not putting him on the birth certificate, going through court to establish paternity and petition for full custody OR  withholding the birth completely and possibly changing my name\u2026\n\nWould I be wrong to not go the \u201cright\u201d legal route, bc I feel if he found us that could jeopardize things in the future", "ups": 53, "permalink": "/r/amiwrong/comments/16qinst/am_i_wrong_to_withhold_the_birth_of_my_child_from/", "num_comments": 26}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Do not tell him a thing.

It is all ab control with him\u2026never an inability. He\u2019s mad that I left a state that I knew almost no one in and that he doesn\u2019t have the same hold over me that he did. His reasoning to everyone on why I left is that I \u201cleft over a title\u201d (I would get fed up and say we shouldn\u2019t be together anymore, he would agree, we\u2019d get back together, and he broke up with me the last time) when in reality he broke a lease we would be moving into in 3 weeks and left me working full time, pregnant not knowing where I would live next on top of all of these other things. That was the final thing that opened my eyes. So I coordinated with and got help from my 80 year old grandfather (only family within hours, live almost 2 hours away) gave away everything in my apartment at the time for free, packed what I could in my car, and drove almost 20 hours back home with my cat while he went on a second trip out of town", "ups": 12, "depth": 2, "author": "Kosmic_kittyy", "replies": []}]}]}, {"selftext": "I am generally a big fan of men being forced to support their children, but you can't do that here without risking your life and you child's life.

{"post": {"title": "Am I Wrong for helping my best friend's boyfriend leave her?", "subreddit": "amiwrong", "selftext": "I (26f) have known my best fried (Laura 27F) since we were little. We met in first grade and have been friends ever since but became best friends when we were in 4th grade. I love this girl and just about everything about her. She's driven, very street smart, confident, beautiful, funny, and always has my back as much as I have hers. Nothing ever comes between us. Not even men. \n\nThe only thing that I don't like about her is how she treats her boyfriends. She tends to bully them to the point that it looks more like abuse. She's controlling, vindictive, manipulative, and will start fights just because she feels like it. Because of this behavior, she gets cheated on or dumped a lot and she thinks she never does anything wrong and tends to even twist stories or arguments so she can win. \n\nA couple years ago, Laura started dating this guy (Tony 29M) and she fell head over heals with him. He's tall, hard working, in good shape, and very motivated. I liked him but not romantically, his energy and smile are just very contagious. The relationship started nicely, he was a bit hard to get but once she was his, he was stuck to her. Problem is their relationship went south very fast. \n\nLaura was already demanding things like access to his phone, tracking his location, interrogating him, and starting fights not even 6 months into the relationship. He denied her access to his phone basically the entire relationship when she decided to just grab it out of his hand \"as a joke\" and then continuously complained about wanting to be able to go through it and how he won't give her the password. She even would start fights because he wasnt ready to talk about kids early early on in the relationship. Because of this, Tony had tried to leave her multiple times but she would try to guilt trip him into staying with her or outright bully him into staying with her.\n\nEventually, surprise surprise, he chested on her and he got caught. He genuinely felt bad and she began to lose it. This made things a lot worse. He tried to work it out with her but she pretty much cranked it all up to 11. She would start fights and through shade in front of family, give him dirty looks, interrogate him even more, start more fights, and again act justified in her behavior. \n\nI was fine with it for a bit as I understand getting cheated on is no fun but it continued on for the next 3 years. Since then, his mental health deteriorated, he gain a lot of weight, he lost his job and had to get something that paid a lot less, he's been suicidal, and basically been screaming for an out. He's tried to leave her numerous times and each time she had ruined that by either stealing his credit card and maxing it out so he can't pay for the move, sabotaging his car, stealing his phone or wallet, etc. Even their sex life died as they hadn't had sex in 2 years because he didn't want to touch her.\n\nI had told her many times to just let him go but she refused. I even told her that he is now being held there against his will and she didn't care. I wished I could help but I didn't know how I could without it seem like I was conspiring against her. \n\nFast forward to this year back in May. Laura went to visit her friends that were out of the country. She traveled a lot without him. She would keep am eye on him with the security cameras and of course track his phones location. I got a call from her asking me to check on the house because she had very spotty signal where she was and couldn't view the cameras. I told her I would do a quick drive by to see if everything is good. She told me she had a vehicle notification from the cameras but couldn't watch it. \n\nI drove out there about 20 minutes from my house. Sure enough there was another vehicle at the house. A moving van. I pulled over blocking the truck and got out. I asked him what was going on. He said it's exactly what it looks like and if I'm going to tell Laura that I can tell her but he's not stopping this time. I stood there for a minute silent and contemplating while he through boxes in the back. I then asked, is there anything else in the house? I helped him pack what was left and close up the van. He drove off but not before I gave him my number. Later that day, he sent me a thank you text for helping him load up.\n\nI told Laura that everything seemed fine at the house and the vehicle notification might have been a car passing by. She gave me the thumbs up and said she will talk to me when she could. \n\nI text him back asking what now to which he replied he needs to start rebuilding and that he needs to go back to therapy  which I didn't know he was going through. I asked to join him in support and he allowed it. When the day came for his appointment that week, I learned so much about him and some of his previous trauma (parental domestic violence, child abuse, child hood sexual abuse, severe depression and anxiety, and addiction). I also learned that Laura basically forced him out of therapy saying it's a waste of money. After the session, I asked if he can just keep me posted on his recovery just so i can make sure he is okay. I knew he had no reason to trust me but I ensured him that I wouldn't tell Laura anything or his whereabouts for his safety. \n\nLater that week, Laura returned to the States and I picked her up. She was so happy to be home but I was faking my smile a bit because I knew what was gonna happen as soon as she got home. Once she got home, she immediately knew something was wrong. House was empty (at least devoid of him and his stuff) and she panicked. All I did was play along and she blew up his phone with texts and calls. She couldn't get through because he had blocked her so she tried calling on my phone. Thankfully she didn't see the messages he and I exchanged. No answer. \n\nI got a call from Laura the next day and she was flamed at me. She saw the video of the moving van and found me helping him pack and load. She asked why I lied and I had no choice but to tell her how I felt. I told her it made me sick that she treated him the way she did and that she needed to recognize that it's not justified no matter how wrong he was. This put a huge strain on our friendship and we haven't spoke in months.

{"post": {"title": "(UPDATE 2)", "subreddit": "amiwrong", "selftext": "(UPDATE)\n\n\nIm gonna clarify some things and answer the most asked questions \n\n1) Do I intend to stay with my wife? No, I've already decided on divorce\n\n2) Why do I refer to My wife son as \"our son\" and my daughter as \"My daughter\" My daughter doesn't call my wife mom she calls her by her name, which makes sense since her mom is still very involved in her life. Naturally, I'd refer to my daughter as \"my daughter.\" As for my exes son, I've known him since he was 7, and he didn't have any farther figure in his life he calls me dad and I treat like my own. I thought it would be easier to understand throughout the story.\n\n3) Why won't my daughter just cook her own food? Well, if yall read the story throughly, yall would see where I said that my wife admitted to not buying most of my daughter's grocery list. This, of course, limits the food my daughter can cook and eat herself. She believes that it's a waste of money and should be used on snacks, her son prefers, and extra food.\n\n4) How bad is my daughters relationship with her bio mom? My daughter and her bio mom relationship is very good she's never been neglectful towards her from what i know of. She lived with her bio mom from ages (12-15) I think she's keen on staying with Me to try a different arrangement and get a break from her bio mom as I know she Can be a little crazy.  And I mean that in a good way.\n\n5) Why doesn't my daughter she eat the food my wife makes instead of throwing a fit? It's not as simple as just eating the food. She gets physically ill. Seriously, we try every now and then to expand her palette (no luck) she literally will gag and vomit the food. \n\n6) Am I going to let her pay for her own groceries? Absolutely not. Children shouldn't have to worry about making sure they can eat no matter what age they are. That's the parent job. \n\n7) How is my wife only going grocery shopping for a while month? On the first of every money, my wife goes grocery shopping with our budget being 1k- 1.5k \n8) My work schedule: 5am- 9pm. Off on weekends and holidays.\n\n9) Why am I letting my daughter leave instead of my wife?  My daughter has a choice to stay with me or her mother she's choosing to stay with me. My wife will be the one leaving once the divorce is finalized. \n\n10) Have I told my wife or the kids that I've decided on divorce ? No , not tonight. I will be having a sit down with both my kids separately and one with everyone together.\n\nI do teach my daughter how to manage her money. My daughter is a junior, so she is usually busy with a lot. She also plays soccer, volleyball, and is on the student council at her school. She shouldn't have to worry about having a meal to eat when she gets home. I'm not saying that she is too young to go grocery shopping herself. But you get the point.\n\n  My daughter isn't upset with my wife. She sympathizes with her because she knows it is difficult to accommodate someone with her taste pallete and is still insisting that I give my wife another chance.  This is heartbreaking because my wife openly admitted to putting her own son needs before my daughters. Which I'm not mad at. protect yours, right? But still, I don't play favorites with her son and my daughter, and if our roles were reversed, I'd bend over backward to accommodate him. \n \n People are also confused about how I didn't notice before. My wife always told me that she made a separate meal for my daughter, which I believed. I mean, I had no reason not to. My daughter is a huge people pleaser, so of course she didn't say anything, probably because she was scared to drive a bridge between me and my wife.  \n\n for the narrow-minded people saying that my daughter is being dramatic, think of it as you being forced to eat something you are extremely allergic to. You wouldn't want to, and you shouldn't be forced to. \n\nPeople are saying that my wife's neglect towards our daughter is far more serious so I'm going to put my daughter in therapy because I know she won't just come out and say what other issues her and my wife have been having. \n\nMy daughter isn't literally going hungry she has a job. Still, she shouldn't be spending money on takeout every night. Me not forcing me to eat for she can't keep down isn't me spoiling her, and for the people saying she should just suck it up, I need to seek help. I feel extremely guilty as a parent for not seeing my daughter being neglected sooner, and I hope my relationship with her can he fixed.\n \nI'm also going to look into all the conditions yall are saying my daughter might have.

People keep asking, \"Why don't I handle my daughters grocery shopping?\" Naturally, if your wife knows a out you daughter dietary  preference, you would trust her with your kids' food supply.

(Her leg is broken = Diagnosis; Kids don't starve themselves = opinion) My firstborn had pyloric stenosis at just under 6wks old -- usually doesn't happen until 3mos-6mos. Basically the valve at the bottom of the stomach outgrows its lining, and food can't get out of the stomach. The stomach will push and push, and the food will rebound off the bottom of the stomach and right out the throat, resulting in what appears to be projectile vomiting. I had every nurse and my mother and my grandmother, who is a pediatric ICU nurse, and one of the other doctors at my pediatrician's practice, tell me that he was just spitting up, first born boys do that, it looks like more than it is, I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, and on and on. \n\nI get it, I was 19, it was my first kid, young first time moms tend to panic over nothing... but my gut told me if I didn't get this taken care of, my kid was going to starve. \n\nAfter 4 days, I wound up walking him to the doctor (no car, no money for a bus) and standing at the reception window until the doctor would agree to see him. They moved us to an exam room to stop other parents from complaining that they wouldn't treat my son, and agreed for a nurse to look at him. I'm pretty sure the nurse was just going to do a mental competency check on me, but I got lucky. The nurse picked up my son, and he projectile vomited out into the hallway right onto our doctor. The doctor came right in, gave a two minute exam, and drove us to the ER. He said most parents would never have pushed as hard, until their kid started losing weight, and sometimes irreversible damage is done to their infant's stomach, throat, and intestines. I was crying, because I was so relieved that he believed me and he said it was a simple surgical fix.\n\nSince then, I have always trusted that I know my kids better than the doctor does. The doctor knows medicine, but not necessarily everything.\n\nWe're also very blessed to be living in the Information Age, where we can Google things we don't know, and at least learn some questions to ask, and help doctors treat us and our kids.\n\nAlso, your last statement: I have a fairly severe allergy to sulfites, which are in just about everything. My husband has done the work to learn about sulfites and how to cook without them, down to making our own baking soda, but I don't expect him to never eat sulfites again. However, there is nowhere I can safely eat but our house. I've had so many people think I am so rude because I always reject any offers for food and drink except plain water when we are out. They can't imagine being so allergic to basically everything... \n\nMy mother-in-law insists that I am just picky, and that it's not a real allergy, even though I always have a reaction when she sneaks things into my food we bring to her house. My adoptive mother agrees, though she doesn't tamper with my food (and never has, and taught me to cook simple things for myself if I \"didn't like\" what she served -- even though I wasn't diagnosed until 33).\n\nA few of my closest friends will try once or twice to prepare a meal with my restrictions (also allergic to milk and soy and celiac), and they are always surprised at how hard it is to cook for me, and I have only had one friend who was stubborn enough to get it right ... on her tenth or so try.

I asked her what was going on. My wife was hesitant as she didn't want to have this talk at all. But finally she said she hates cooking for my daughter. She said that it was to much to go out of her way to constantly go out of her way to accommodate her and how annoying it was to always make sure the food is cooked to a certain texture and seasoned to my daughter's liking she then revealed that she stopped cooking food the way my daughter liked because our son didnt like it. She then proceeded to say that my daughter just needs to grow as it was only food and wouldn't kill her and how her being picky was just to draining. I asked why she didn't have a sit down with our kids to make some sort of compromise and she said her son needs came before my daughters. She also revealed that she had straight up stopped buying more than half of my daughters personalized grocery list because it was a waste of money and that our son what snacks that he wanted. I was dumbfounded and asked her if she was just going to let my daughter go hungry, to which she responded by sayibg all she has to do is eat the food she cooked. I asked her what was draining about putting 1 or 2 pieces of plain chicken aside. She said that I wouldn't get it because I didn't cook for my daughter like she did. Which was true as I'm at work from 5-9 and i only cook dinner on weekends, holidays and holiday breaks . She apologized to me but suggested that I should convince my daughter to eat the food she doesn't like because it would make everyone's life easier. I then asked her If she would think the same thing if it was our son and she didn't respond which was answer enough. I don't know what to do now, If she's willing to let my daughter go hungry how else would she be willing to neglect my daughter? What should I do now? \n\n(Q-A) My daughter is in no way overweight ans she doesn't only eat junk food for vegetables she eats carrots, lettuce, corn, asparagus, and  cucumbers. For fruit she eats watermelon, dragonfruit, apples, and mangos. \n My daughter can in fact cook. The only reason she did not is because her fall break is coming up and my wife didn't buy her entire  grocery list so she saving it. Which is honestly crazy because no kid should have to worry about how much food they can eat when they're hungry.\n My daughter told her bio mom and she upset and is suggesting that my daughter goes to live with her. My daughter chooses who she spends the year with herself and if she wants to go I won't stop her because I don't want my daughter in a house she's being neglected in. \n Also I DO NOT in ANY way force my wife to cook for my daughter, in fact she insists on cooking for her, and if she came to Me and said she didn't want to cook for my daughter I would understand and wake up early to fix her food for the day or switch my schedule around. \n  My wife goes on 1 grocery run for the entire month so if she isn't getting everything on my daughter's grocery list of course my daughter meals will be limited. \n I talked with My daughter and she isn't mad at my wife at all and is even pushing me to forgive her. It's frustrating cause my 16 year old daughter is trying to fix our marriage while my wife basically said she could care less about my daughter. My daughter is also willing to go grocery shopping with my wife and pay for her own food so there isn't anymore conflict.

{"post": {"title": "Am I wrong for being upset my bf repeatedly left me on read and for wanting him to speak more nicely to me?", "subreddit": "amiwrong", "selftext": "My (32f) boyfriend (43m) got into a fight last night. It started when I just walked into the room and said \u201cbabe\u201d and he snapped \u201cwhat?!\u201d And I said \u201cjeez, I just wanted to say thanks for making us dinner and I love ya\u201d and while I felt defeated a bit by him snapping, I quickly got over it (as this happens at least a couple times a week). \n\nThen 5-10 mins later I heard him make a disgruntled sound and looked over and saw his brows were all furrowed and so I asked \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong? Ya good?\u201d And he snapped again with something like \u201cJesus stop bothering me! Stop asking me what\u2019s wrong! Nothings wrong. Can\u2019t I just make food in peace?! God damn\u201d \n\nI got deflated again but I shut up and sat at the table and waited for dinner. After we finished eating, he was telling me the agenda for his friends upcoming visit to stay with us for the weekend, and he told me he was going to drop his buddy off on an afternoon hike\u2026\n\n(Side note for context: we live in Arizona and that trail is literally blocked off some afternoons so people don\u2019t die trying to hike in the heat)\n\n\u2026so unfortunately at that point I made a mistake because I interrupted him to say something like \u201cmake sure he checks the mountain and the schedule/rules to make sure he can hike that afternoon\u201d however as soon as I started to talk, my bf exploded and started screaming about me ruining his story, interrupting him, acting like a pussy bitch because I\u2019m worried about his friend climbing a mountain and that his friend is a grown man and can climb a damn mountain whenever he wants (not realizing that they will literally turn you away if it\u2019s too hot in the midday/afternoon and that\u2019s all I was trying to say so he\u2019d be sure to research ahead of time)\n\nIn the spiel of yelling he also called me annoying and said that I talk too much (this is a recurring complaint of his)\n\nSo I got upset and started crying and I left the dining room table and I went to the guest bedroom and I texted him \u201cI\u2019m sorry I annoy you. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t say the right words. And that the words I say make you react so negatively. Texting you so I don\u2019t talk. And I\u2019m also just gonna hang in the guest room fyi. Thanks for cooking\u201d \u2014 and I ended up falling asleep in there. \n\nWhen I woke up in the middle of the night, he had gone to our bedroom and closed the door, but he also didn\u2019t even open the text I sent him. \n\nI was upset that he didn\u2019t care enough to even read my text; so while laying in the guest bedroom, I sent two more texts explaining how I felt and asking him if he even wanted to be with me, because the way he talked to me made me think he doesn\u2019t really want to be with me. I eventually fell back asleep. \n\nThen this morning he\u2019s all in a good mood like nothing happened. After about an hour he commented that I seemed like I was in a bad mood and that I was too quiet and being weird, and I told him that I had explained why in the texts I had sent him overnight. He said \u201cI\u2019m not reading those. That\u2019s stupid and crazy. I didn\u2019t even open them, I\u2019m not gonna read them\u201d \u2014 and I was a little shocked and I was upset that he could read texts from his friends and scroll his phone but would even read/open my text\u2026so I just sat there in silence, and we ran our Saturday morning errands in silence\n\nLater that afternoon, I tried to test the waters and talk to him again and he immediately snapped at me saying \u201coh now you wanna talk?! You were in a mood all morning and moping and being quiet, and now you wanna talk?! No thanks. Don\u2019t want to talk to you\u201d\n\nand so I started crying and essentially just like begging him to speak nicer to me or to not act so angry to me, and that set him off even more and we got into a huge screaming match and I asked him if we should break up or if he wanted to break up because he seems so negative \u2014 and he threw back that we don\u2019t have sex enough (more context on that: he\u2019s not wrong but during COVID he gained 100 pounds and I gained 50 pounds, and I got diagnosed with PCOS, so libido has definitely been lower these days but I\u2019m also working with a personal trainer, and taking supplements and really trying to improve my health as much as I can so I feel more secure and healthy and get my libido fully back), he also asked me / accused me of cheating on him which is outrageous because I\u2019m at home 24/7 and I have no interest in cheating or being with anyone else.  Then, in the middle of our screaming match, he left to play golf with his buddy. While he was leaving I admit I threw out an ultimatum I probably shouldn\u2019t have and said something like \u201cIf you go golfing it might be the last time you golf from this house\u201d (as in we might be broken up when you come back and you\u2019ll have to move out; because I own the house we live in). \n\nBut he left anyway and golfed two rounds with a Buddy of his. \n\nWhile he was still golfing, after I had calmed down, I sent him a text to apologize for what I had said and the ultimatum, and I assured him I do not really want to break up, but that to stay together we need to talk about our intimacy and improve our communication, and specify our needs to each other and commit to doing our best to meeting each others needs and supporting each other in a loving way \n\nI had hoped he would reply with understanding or with at least being willing to talk or meet in the middle but he didn\u2019t even read anything I texted him and essentially just called me crazy \n\nHe\u2019s says I\u2019m insane and that I can lay in the bed I\u2019ve made. He\u2019s done and he\u2019ll move out within two weeks. \n\nI feel numb. That\u2019s why I\u2019m posting here, maybe for some perspective? I pretty much just wanna know if it sounds like I\u2019m in the wrong here? \n\n(Tbh when I write it out like this and reread it, it\u2019s clearer to me that there might be some emotional or verbal abuse going on, and maybe it\u2019s better if we breakup, but it\u2019s so hard when you\u2019re in it and you love someone and on the good days things are really good, so it\u2019s hard not to put blinders about the negativity and yelling that happens repeatedly \u2014 but also he really does have me questioning if I\u2019m crazy and in the wrong)\n\nI greatly appreciate any insight", "ups": 2, "permalink": "/r/amiwrong/comments/16qojd5/am_i_wrong_for_being_upset_my_bf_repeatedly_left/", "num_comments": 39}, "replies": [{"selftext": "You\u2019re absolutely in an abusive relationship and and effort spent to stay in it is worse than wasted", "ups": 13, "depth": 0, "author": "PandaSchmanda", "replies": [{"selftext": "Hard to hear.

During this break he also had sex with another girl. My question is if I should leave him or get back together with him this is the story. We started dating in march and he had a lot of flirty girl \u201cfriends\u201d I told him that made me uncomfortable and it took a little convincing but he got rid of them. Every month or so I would catch him talking to them very flirty, and we took that break because he sent one of them a shirtless picture and talked shit about me to her. He\u2019s left bruises on me but he hasn\u2019t like punched me or anything like that.He\u2019s constantly talking down on me calling me a whore or a skank and saying I\u2019m greedy and selfish and a lot of things . So anyway yesterday I broke up with him because I found out he added a girl he almost had sex with on snap then proceeded to delete Snapchat. And he has cheated in the past with a girl at the gym so I have a right to be suspicious and look at his phone. So I wanted to see his Snapchat because I had a really weird gut feeling and he just was texting his ex like a month ago so I wanted to make sure he wasn\u2019t doing it again so I went to look for Snapchat and it wasn\u2019t there so I went to download it and he snatched his phone away from me so fast and I told\nHim to show me who\u2019s on the his snap and he wouldn\u2019t so he was gaslighting me for a whole 30 mins telling me that there was no one and I was crazy and I have no reason not to trust him. Well I found out he added this girl that he\u2019s talked ab having sex with in the past. Am I in the wrong should I get back together with him because now he\u2019s saying that he\u2019s going to be perfect but he\u2019s said that before and idk what to do.\n\n\nUPDATE: thank you everyone for all the support I just a wanted to add a couple details.

AIW", "subreddit": "amiwrong", "selftext": "M(29) broke up with gf(26) \u201cLana\u201d \nSo we had been dating over about 8 months before I decided to end things. We were in the talking stage for 3 months. Around month 5 of dating she asked me one night if i had been talking to anyone during our talking stage. I told her yes, i had been talking to 2 other girls but after 2 weeks of getting to know Lana I stopped talking to the other 2. Lana asked if I still speak to them and I told her not at all. She smiled and said \u201cso I was the one\u201d and giggled. I didn\u2019t think much of it at all that night. \n\nA week after she told me she was getting coffee with a friend, I didn\u2019t think much of that either. Then one night we went to Lana\u2019s friend\u2019s bday party. One of her friends there asked if I had gone to get coffee with Lana and her friend the week before and I said no I was helping my parents move out of their old house. I told him I had assumed she went with one of them in their friend group and he didn\u2019t respond. So I asked another friend and she said she went with some guy named Dan, that she had assumed he was a friend of mine. Then I realized during our talking phase she had told me about some guy she was talking to named Dan. \n\nThe next night I asked her about it and she said yeah she went with Dan that they\u2019re just friends. So I asked her how many of the guys she was talking to before me are now just friends and she says all of them. I was uncomfortable with that and I told her that. She was upset and said i was overthinking it, so I took some space for a week because it hurt me, but ultimately felt maybe I was overthinking it and continued my relationship with Lana. \n\nFast forward to a week before the break up, I find out she\u2019s still talking to the guys she talked to before me and I told her that when I first found out it made me uncomfortable and that it hurt and that knowing she still is, I still feel the same way. she told me to get over it that they\u2019re all just friends and that stung so i told her if she doesn\u2019t care about how I feel than I would be going my separate way. She told me I was being controlling so I broke up with her. \n\nIt\u2019s been 2 months and now she\u2019s texting me that she has deleted all of the guys contacts and that she was wrong and wants to get back together. That it\u2019s wrong of me to throw all of what we have built away. I still feel hurt from it all and I haven\u2019t answered back.

{"post": {"title": "Am I wrong for not letting my ex come visit to see my dog?", "subreddit": "amiwrong", "selftext": "So my ex (30F) and myself (31M) broke up two years ago after I caught her cheating.  Instead of owning her mistake, she instead decided to gaslight me and lie about me to people (she didn't want people to know she cheated so made up things about me to justify the break up) and among other things, basically made me not trust her at all.  She also threatened to steal the two dogs we shared together.  I kept them after the break up since I kicked her out and she was staying with mutual friends and didn't have a job so couldn't afford vet/grooming bills let alone dog food.\n\nAnyway, we tried at first to do a sort of custody agreement of the dogs.  But again, due to her comments about stealing them, I didn't trust her.  I wrote up a contract that basically gave ownership to me and asked her to sign it.  The theory behind this was that if I did let her take the dogs for an agreed upon time and she decided not to give them back, I could call the cops for theft instead of trying to take her to civil court.  I tried to explain this to her but she wouldn't listen and refused to sign it.  I then contacted her family (mom, dad, sister, and BIL).  They all agreed that it made sense and said that they would talk to her.  Yet, they couldn't convince her to sign.  I then explained to her further that due to her recent actions and comments, I could not trust her unless she signed it.  She still refused to sign, to which I told her then she would not be seeing them.  She then said \"whatever\" or something to that effect and I left it alone.\n\nA year goes by and she texts me out of the blue telling me she got a new dog and wanted our dogs to meet her new one.  I told her that it had been over a year and I thought that it may be traumatizing for my dogs to see her after a year with a new dog.  She actually agreed and it was the most civil conversation we had since I caught her cheating.\n\nThen another year passes and I decide to move to another state.  I'm not sure if she heard about me moving or just had bad timing, but she messages me the day after I put my house on the market and put my two weeks in on my job to ask to see the dogs.  I tell her I'm fine with it but it would be a goodbye since we are moving.  She immediately begins to insult me, calling me a monster and everything else for keeping the dogs from her.  So I just block her and move to the other state.\n\nNow to the crux of the issue.  Last week, my oldest dog passed away from natural causes.  I believed that my ex at least had the right to know and maybe get some ashes or something.  She was civil at first, but slowly turned into blaming me for the dog's death and even called the vet to get dirt (the vet called me warning me she was calling them).  Then she says she wants to come down to see the other dog.  I don't think it's a good idea and told her as much.  She obviously doesn't agree and thinks I'm a monster.  Am I wrong to tell her no, she can't come visit?

It\u2019s like you expect it and do it in return. I never took a liking to that. I understand a lot of people like it but I feel like it crosses my physical boundary. I don\u2019t even like it when my own mom kisses me on the cheek.

Even if someone were to kiss me I would tell them that I don\u2019t want that and to please respect it.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is from South Korea and in Korean culture you don\u2019t kiss family members on the cheek or really hug in any way. I always took a liking to the idea of that because it\u2019s like the one thing that makes me uncomfortable I don\u2019t have to do in his culture. My mom would always say how weird my fianc\u00e9 is for not wanting to be hugged by her, anyone else that isn\u2019t me, or anyone that he meets from my family or people that know my mom. She would even say when she would try to hug him it felt like hugging a lifeless body. I tried to tell her it\u2019s not a part of his culture and to please respect his wishes. She then would turn around and say he needs to respect my Italian culture and display physical affection. I tried to insist to her that we\u2019re not doing anything we feel uncomfortable with.

She's not close with majority of us but neither of us has any ill will towards her because she's a dependable and hard worker which we all appreciate.\r  \n\r  \nOne thing we picked up very quickly about Sandy is that she's a foodie, despite being a stick figure. For the 2 years she has worked with us, she's been sharing a lot of sweets with us. Some of us, including myself, are working on our weight loss. We'd like to joke that Sandy is ruining our diets, but deep down, we're all upset with Sandy's thoughtlessness, especially since she knows which one of us are on a diet. She says she thinks we look great, but that's not the issue. It's hard to avoid temptation. And when we have the strength to, we feel left out that everyone else gets to enjoy something you can't have.\r  \n\r  \nAnother co-worker, Danielle (F40's), is one of those that's been working on eating healthy. She recently had to euthanize her dog. Sandy seems to have a problem with consolation cards. I know she's not much of a talker, but how much effort would it take to write, \"I'm sorry for your loss\"? I know she can do it. She's written thank you cards before. In the past, when other co-workers has been grieving, she'd avoid the cards like the plague. Instead she would make an excuse by telling the grieving person she's going to the store and ask them if there's anything she can get for them. Which is the same she did with Danielle. Next thing we know, Sandy came back with 2 big boxes of Choco Pies.\r  \n\r  \nI told her that it's nice that she's thinking about making Danielle feel better but she's doing it wrong. What Danielle needs is for us to let her know that we're there for her, which was the point of the card. Buying her things that she's going to regret later on is going to make things worse for her. Sandy said she's sorry and that she has always struggled with talking. Even when writing or typing, it takes her hours to overlook every word to make sure everything looks good. I suggested seeking therapy to work whatever issues she has, but she says she is which was a surprise for me. I told her that she needs to be more considerate of other people's feelings and struggles. She says she's sorry and will try to do better.\n\nAnother co-worker, Alicia (F20's), came to talk to me. Alicia is one of the few people here that Sandy is close with. I don't know what Sandy told Alicia, but apparently Alicia thought I was being the inconsiderate one. She even went so far as calling me fatphobic. I know I'm a little smaller than Alicia, but still heavyset so it's confusing she'd call me that.\r  \n\r  \nMaybe I was too harsh on Sandy. But at the same time, I'm asking for a little more understanding.\r  \n\r  \nAm I wrong?", "ups": 0, "permalink": "/r/amiwrong/comments/16qjmut/am_i_wrong_for_asking_my_co_worker_to_be_more/", "num_comments": 22}, "replies": [{"selftext": "You\u2019re wrong.

After we have our babies my fianc\u00e9 and I will be traveling for the holidays to spend it at my moms house in Puerto Rico then we go back to NYC (where we live) for 2 weeks and then we move to Australia.

Then I said where our wedding was going to be and how my dress was going to look like and showed her pick of what we had so far. And I said that we weren\u2019t really doing a honeymoon but we were having a family trip instead (me,my fianc\u00e9 and our twins). \n\nI always try and be cautious about how I say things and where I say them , I do understand that not everyone has these privileges,I didn\u2019t even have them 6 years ago.

About a month ago I had enough and called her out regarding snapping other guys. So one of them is married to her best friend. She told me he would always say sexually disgusting things to her, and it made her uncomfortable. Come to find out, he was trying to get her to have a threesome with him and his wife. While this happened before we started dating, I\u2019m still very uneasy about the whole situation. Then there is another guy she always  snaps and I don\u2019t even know his name. He is an \u201conline friend\u201d in which she has never met. Now my issue with this is that she never told me about, and my biggest issue is that she hid him from me. There are other guy friends she talks to that I have absolutely no problem with, but these two really bothered me. \n\nWe had the discussion about it and she told me that her and her wife\u2019s husband are really good friends and she doesn\u2019t wanna ruin that relationship. We had the discussion and she apologized. She kept trying to delete social media and Snapchat but I told her that\u2019s not what she should do. Just set a boundary. \n\nIt has been a month since that happened and she continues to snap these guys. I\u2019ve also noticed she always puts her phone screen down when she is t using it, and if I walk on the room she immediately gets off her phone. \n\nLast night I was straight up and told her that I\u2019m having a big issue trusting her.

When I try to express my concern and just try to tell her to be careful, she gets offended and blows me off as if I'm being an overblown parent. This isn't the only thing she makes it hard to be expressive about though. She will have this kind of aggressive behavior with most things that I try to support or talk to her about. She always seems to get offended and blows me off. \n\nOf course, with all of these failed and rejected attempts of trying to communicate, I feel like I'm not being listened to and that my thoughts don't matter. I am getting rather fed up internally and feel as though I can't talk about any of it as it might just cause another struggle between us. Am I wrong for trying to initiate my communication?

They are homeschooled by my wife (this isn't a homeschool post but she is college educated, takes homeschooling very seriously, and builds rigorous age appropriate secular curriculums for them). They meet up with other kids in our local secular homeschool groups and participate in multiple sports throughout the year.\n\nWe don't own a television. The kids have each watched maybe 10 hours of TV in their lives. We don't own any tablets although they have used my phone to build their mario lego sets (the instructions are available only via an app). They use facetime to talk to family, and they are aware of what youtube is as I will sometimes use it to find an education video about something they are confused about or when I'm following a youtube video for a home improvement project. My oldest wanted to write a book so we got him a word processor and he taught himself to type properly with a book and practice. That progressed to access to a laptop with no internet which he uses to write books in word (no other apps are on it). They've never played a video game. They both read voraciously. We're not anti-movie night but neither my wife nor I really enjoy movies so we haven't implemented it yet.\n\nIn their free time they do what my wife and I did as kids...play in our large yard which is surrounded by woods, build forts, play with the chickens and dogs, play sports and board games, read, draw, build legos, play their guitars and drum sets, ride their 4 wheelers or dirt bikes, jump on the trampoline, and sometimes they're bored too. My wife and I are lucky enough to be able to afford to reasonably indulge in their interests (my youngest loves to build so we got him his own drill and accessories and tool kit for example).\n\nBetween today and college they will of course be introduced to technology. One day they'll have their own smart phones and laptops.

It was great for a while. But when we went to middle school I noticed a change in him when he made some new friends. He was meaner to me and didn\u2019t care if his other friends bullied me. I don\u2019t know why I stayed friends with him so long. Probably because he was my only friend at the time. I tried to include him in stuff I tried to do fun things with him but he always had a last minute excuse for me. I was tired of it but of course stayed friends with him. We are now seniors in high school. Recently I went over to his house to discuss some things with him and I was treated horribly by him and his friend. I texted him that I was at his house, knocked on the door, called him multiple times but never answered. I finally knocked loud enough he heard and he asked what I was going here when I had told him I was going to stop by. Then I saw that he and his friend were playing games on their phone while I was standing outside waiting for someone to answer the door. So i\u2019d assumed he ignored my calls and texts. When I got into his room he gave me the silent treatment, dismissed me, and ignored me when I had a question.  I was pissed so I told him I was leaving, not even a bye from him just an ok. I told my parents about it and they said that\u2019s how he has always treated them and I had never noticed till now. I took their advise and cut contact with him.

One late night around 3 am his phone bussed which made me look at it. I decided to go through his phone and looked at his deleted text messages. I saw he had been texting an unknown number. The messages were casual at first then turned flirty. He always tells me \u201cI will whip or whoop you\u201d as a form of flirting with me so to see him say it to someone else hurts. She replied \u201cwell it\u2019s you so you can do it if you like.\u201d He replied \u201cwill do.\u201d Then she asked to hang some time and he said \u201csure we can.\u201d \n\nI looked up her number and it was from a girl. I found her name on his Facebook and went through his messenger. She sent him lotssss of nudes and naked videos of her playing with herself a year before we started dating. This hurts because, at the beginning of our relationship, he attempted to cheat on me with any other ex when he allegedly \u201cgot drunk\u201d and I didn\u2019t find this out until we hit the 8th-month mark in our relationship. His ex works with us so I have to see her face all the time. I was so butt hurt and cried a lot. He\u2019s my first love so this hurts so bad.

I waited in line at wendy's. Long line. Get up to the speaker, no answer. I ask and waited 4-5 minutes, no answer. So I pull up to the window thinking maybe it was broken. The guy at the window (new manager) told me to get to the back of the line and called me a liar because nobody asked if anyone was there on the drive thru speaker. I even asked the woman in the car behind me and she yelled out yes, I was waiting at the speaker a while. He called her a liar too, she left. And I still demanded to place my order and he refused to take it. Then he pretended his register was broken and couldn't do a thing about it. So I just sat there and waited, car turned off. Eventually the long line of people just gave up.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nMore details on that. During the wait he was recording me as I recorded him as well because he was angry and yelling.  I was very nice at first but the whole 'get back to the end of the line' out of a long line I had already waited a LONG time really pissed me off. So, I told him to then just get someone else to take my order, he refused, and then was on another phone calling apparently HIS manager on what to do and all I got from what he was saying is he couldn't do anything because he kept saying are you sure are you sure and then started screaming, slamming shit in the store and stormed out.   \n\n\nThe workers there, however, told me that he was new, and yet this isn't the first incident he's caused and they were glad to have the break because...well nobody was coming now that there was an unmoving line. I even offered to pay for the order but they ended up giving me what I wanted and then some for free.  \n\n\nHowever, as much as I thought about it like a funny story and when I retold it I never really had to talk about the long line behind me and just the asshole behavior of the 'manager'. I'm just wondering like... would I still be considered wrong because technically I could have taken the L and wasted time by myself, but what I did ended up guaranteeing quite a few more people to waste their time (although not sure if he'd have pulled more stuff against them as well so this is the difference between possibly and guaranteed time wasting.)  \n\n\nHow would you have felt about being in that line behind me?", "ups": 6, "permalink": "/r/amiwrong/comments/16pwedz/was_i_wrong_for_blocking_a_wendys_drive_thru/", "num_comments": 20}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I have a bit of a different take that might be a little bit off from what you're asking.\n\nI don't understand the customers that DEMAND service when they are treated like shit.

We had a lovely time sightseeing and dinner. It got quite late in the night before we realised it. We had plans that he would come back to my place and watch Netflix together and he goes home after since I have an early start for work the next day. I told him to come over anyway, just stay at mine and I\u2019ll try to be as quiet as I can whilst getting ready for work so he doesn\u2019t get disrupted. Mind you, he has stayed over COUNTLESS times at mine, averaging probably twice a week. \n\nHe lives with his dad and younger sister. Dad often works late leaving just him and sister at home. His sister is 19. \n\nAs I was suggesting this idea to him, he tells me he needs to ask his sister and she will decide if he can stay over or not. I was immediately appalled. It\u2019s our FIRST ANNIVERSARY. He has stayed over many times. I was kind of pissed. I told him that it\u2019s a bad look if he doesn\u2019t want to stay with me coz his little sister said no.

He stopped making any jokes about that kind of thing when I told him I found it hurtful to joke that I would have a secret BF or whatever, but for him to come back and be suspicious while insinuating that I was doing something inappropriate with my professor was more than I had patience for or wanted to entertain.

He did not take his words back nor apologise for any of that. Have you received a proper apology for the whole behaviour ever since you posted this, OP?\n\n3. His messages bear malice: look at the difference between your texts (straightforward, transparent, factual, neutral, open, communicative and explanatory) and his texts (ironic, sarcastic, passive aggressive, contradicting, shutting you down). His communication style mostly consisted of him throwing some stones at you and then walking away while you deal with whatever the stones broke. \n\n4. He did not consider your feelings at any point during this conversation.\n\n5. He did not have the maturity to express the insecurities he is dealing with and instead made it your problem (this is a highly representative trait for narcissism - they want the other person to go out of their way to meet their undeveloped and often questionable needs, and if this is not done, they will punish you psychologically for something that is, in fact, their fault);\n\n6. He gaslit you. He started the conversation by accusing you and indirectly and immaturely reporting a problem on your side, kept it that way, and towards the end of it, after he made sure you were not okay with the situation, he withdrew and made the whole conversation seem like a problem you have in your head, like you made a big deal out of nothing, and like you overreacted to him just \u201cmaking an observation\u201d (highly representative trait for narcissism - making someone feel like they didn\u2019t have the right to get upset and pinpointing it as a fault on their end);\n\n7. Quite problematic is that he shows unwillingness to actually understand what you need in the relationship, and finds ways to weaponise feedback he was given against you (again, this is psychological punishment for something he did not like - perhaps there is some resentment going on).

You made a grave mistake by giving me that feedback a while ago, so now you will see what happens\u201d.\n\n7. The way he kept pushing for you to drop it after he lit the fire without resolution and making sure the last word was going to be his and conclusive of you being clearly wrong, (ie: \u201cNEXT!\u201d) shows none of this was started to work on an issue \u201che simply observed\u201d like he put it, but an attack meant to leave you hurting and to make you go in your head, struggle alone about having upset him, go through the phases of self doubt and double guessing, and ultimately learn your lesson and never annoy him with something like that again.\n\n\nFrom what I see here, you did nothing wrong.\nPlease take care of yourself, as I have dealt with similar: People like this:\n\n- take a very, very long time to self develop, with very high chances of that to never happen at all;\n- are highly resistant to the need to change;\n- need to be convinced with hard work over things which in another relationship, all it would take is a few minutes long healthily communicated agreement where both parties understand how the other person feels and try to reach a middle ground;\n- have deeply rooted issues with themselves: the arrogant unbothered display is a mask for a highly frustrated, fragile and undeveloped person. They cope with this through manipulation and gaslighting, because they persuade people to comfort their inner child rather than go through the painful process of growing up and maturing from their instinctual behaviours;\n- will make you feel like you always have to mend their wrongs and put them at ease after they hurt you;\n- require all of your resources. They don\u2019t like the idea that not everything inside of you may react to the things they say - that means they have lowered control over all that you are.\n\nYou were 100% right to get upset.\nYou were 100% right to feel all of that was wrong and unnecessary.\n\nMy suggestions\u2026 do not feed his ego by either giving in, forgiving him without himself dissecting his wrongs in front of you, letting him see he does reach and break your heart with these behaviours, comforting him before he opens up and fully admits he was malicious and that he turned his own pain and insecurities into a weapon against you, and take notice of patterns. \n\nPatterns are your best friends. \nThey are graphs for the future.\n\nBest wishes!", "ups": 0, "depth": 0, "author": "SilZXIII", "replies": [{"selftext": "Thank you for all of this.

{"post": {"title": "Would I be wrong in not telling my In-laws my baby's gender?", "subreddit": "amiwrong", "selftext": "So I just learned I'm having a baby girl. I also really hate the color pink/ the culture around girls baby showers. How everyone automatically hears \"girl\" and showers everything in Pepto bismol for the first 4 years of their lives. It's been a huge pet peeve ever since I was little as the only options I were given were pink everything, so I always said that if I did have a baby girl there would be little to no pink, and id honestly prefer just neutral clothes and supplies. \n\nHowever, my in-laws are extremely transphobic/ homophobic. Very set in their \"traditional gender roles\" and all that. My father in law especially is the Joe Rogen, \"beer guns and whiskey\" type, will just randomly bring up how men will never be women etc, etc. Ive tried discussing this with them, bringing up actual studies and ya know. Science. But it almost always devolves into \"well I just FEEL that-\" or \"that's not what it means TO REALLY be a man-\" or something to that effect. \n\nI once casually brought up that i might keep the gender a secret and he got all mad and said \"I BETTER know if you want any help from me\" which. I didn't say anything at the time but it really pissed me off, 1) because it's my baby, I don't have to tell anyone I don't want to, 2) who cares? There are plenty of options for babies that aren't gendered and 3) that matters to you more than actually helping out your grandchild? But I digress.\n\nI've already told the people that matter the most to me about it but I'm wondering if it'd be wrong of me to let everyone else know except for them. I don't feel like they'd respect my wishes, or if they eventually found out about it if they'd start fights and be petty about it. I'm not counting on their help but they are pretty well off, far more than my own family and I they could help a whole lot more if they were inclined to. And ultimately I'd use and be grateful for whatever I was given it'll just be really upsetting if all I get is pink, everywhere.\n\n\nEDIT: So a couple things: \n\n1) In-laws have no contact with my side of the family, and they are the only family he is willing to talk to. They would not know unless we told them directly. We both had pretty messed up childhoods and are no/ low contact with a lot of our relatives so they haven't overlapped.\n\n2) There were a couple of instances in the past couple years where they both did some really terrible shit to my partner. Not going into detail but they very nearly destroyed his whole life, and turned around and tried to act like it never happened so the relationship is already strained. The major parts of it happened right before I met him, so it isn't really my relationship to mend, I've just been keeping the peace and supporting him on how he wants to go forward with this\n\n3) personally, I don't really care about their opinions, it's just a headache I shouldn't have to deal with. I'm more worried about them being petty and causing more problems for my spouse.\n\n4) I know I'm inevitable going to get some pink and that's alright. I'd just prefer a wider array of colors. It's just a pet peeve when even shopping for things the boys aisle has all kinds of colors, and the girls is 80% pink. Once they're a little older and can choose I won't care. But for a new born multicolored is better for brain development anyway. And I'm going to be seeing/ using all of this stuff. I actually like the color at times in art/ on other people, it's just not for me.", "ups": 326, "permalink": "/r/amiwrong/comments/16oqz3d/would_i_be_wrong_in_not_telling_my_inlaws_my/", "num_comments": 360}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Tell everyone you're having a little dinosaur, and want only dinosaur-themed baby stuff.

{"post": {"title": "19684 is NOT 196 but bigoted, it\u2019s 196 without s*x", "subreddit": "19684", "selftext": "I never thought this would need to be clarified, but here we are. With the continued growth of this sub over the past year, we have had a large influx of new users. For the most part, this is something we welcome. However, many seem to be under the impression that because this sub is a 196 offshoot and not 196 itself, it will be a place people who get banned from 196 for bigotry can congregate. Almost every trans positive post has been both reported for violating rule 2 even though being trans does not entail discussion of or jokes about s3x (but saying that being trans is just a fetish is a common transphobic trope), and been swarmed with multiple bigoted comments. But no matter how many we ban, more always seem to crop up. So me and the rest of the mod team want to make one thing VERY clear: bigotry of any kind will NOT be tolerated here. \n\nThis is 196 without s3x. Trans people posting here isn't \"196 Invading\": the sub has always been a 196 offshoot. The sub isn't being \"invaded by trans people\": we've been here far longer than you and the sub has always been Trans Supportive. This isn't a transphobic sub. Either shut up, leave, or you WILL be banned. And yes, just to be clear: bigotry against non-binary people or people using Neopronouns is Transphobia. If you continue to be transphobic on this sub, you will both be banned and reported for violating sitewide rules by the mod team. This has always been, and always will be, our policy.\n\nTo my fellow trans people: I want to make it clear that you are welcome here, and bigots aren't. Please continue reporting bigoted comments, and we will continue to remove them. Unfortunately, the sub is large so we can't always catch everything if it isn't brought to our attention, but I promise we are doing our best to ensure the bigots popping up like weeds are banned and their bullshit removed as quickly as possible. This sub is and always will be trans supportive, and nothing will change this. We will not be locking posts for mentioning trans people just because of the difficulty of removing all bigoted comments either. 19684 will always be a trans positive subreddit: if somebody can't accept that, they aren't welcome here.", "ups": 3491, "permalink": "/r/19684/comments/10fm0tb/19684_is_not_196_but_bigoted_its_196_without_sx/", "num_comments": 192}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Because I keep seeing people repeat this, I\u2019m going to add that this is not, and never has been a sub exclusively for shitposting.

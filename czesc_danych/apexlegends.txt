{"post": {"title": "Dev Team Update: DirectX 12 &amp; RHI", "subreddit": "apexlegends", "selftext": "*Hey, Legends.*\n\n*Below are some details surrounding the DirectX 12 (DX12) Beta! Read on to learn more about the motivations for DirectX 12, where it will be taking place, and what you can expect moving forward.*   \n*Please enjoy the following notes from our awesome dev team. We can\u2019t wait to hear your thoughts!* \n\nWith the 18.1 release, the DirectX 12 (DX12) Beta is introducing a major update to our rendering engine, called the Rendering Hardware Interface or RHI. It is our new abstraction layer between the low-level platform rendering APIs (like DX12) and our platform-independent engine and game code.\n\n## WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION?\n\nWhen Apex launched, we supported three platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and DirectX 11 on PC. Over time this has grown to seven different rendering platforms: the original three, plus Xbox Series S/X, PlayStation 5, Switch, and DirectX 12 on PC, each with differing low-level graphics APIs. Implementing rendering features, architectural changes, or even performance optimizations became overly burdensome. Sometimes new code would need to be duplicated up to 7 times, but more commonly, developers spent a lot of time dealing with bugs that might only happen on one or two platforms due to subtle differences in how the rendering backends were implemented. In addition, some architectural choices from the early days of the engine made adding or expanding engine features like multi-threading challenging. Those choices made sense back when typical PC and console hardware were much different, but as multi-core processors became the norm and GPUs became increasingly versatile and powerful, the engine had to change to fully take advantage of these new capabilities.\n\nFortunately, modern APIs across different platforms have become more similar to each other\u2014which gave us more incentive and more confidence that a major architectural upgrade to the engine could be successfully done even on a live game like Apex. The result was the initiative to implement RHI.\n\n## WHERE IS THIS HAPPENING?\n\nInitially, the RHI update will be rolled out in the Windows DX12 Beta only. This will allow us to test the new system with a much larger group of players, but still allow anyone who runs into issues to revert to the standard DX11 version of the game. Eventually, the RHI update will be rolled out to all of our other platforms.\n\n## WHAT CAN PLAYERS EXPECT?\n\nPlaying the new DX12 RHI Beta should be a similar experience to what you\u2019ve already seen in the current DX12 Beta\u2014the general visual look and quality will be the same. As far as performance, we do expect framerates to be slightly lower in this version compared to the previous Beta build. This is mostly due to the RHI system being so new that we're still working to optimize and improve how it integrates with the rest of the game code.  Performance will absolutely be a focus for us on upcoming releases.\n\nHowever, one thing that should be better is the VRAM usage. One big drawback of the previous DX12 implementation was video memory fragmentation compared to the DX11 version. The memory usage should now be comparable between the RHI DX12 and DX11 builds of the game.\n\nFinally, as with any new major engine change, there is the possibility for issues that might affect performance or gameplay. If you encounter any issues, please reach out via [our support](https://help.ea.com/en/help-top-issues/?product=apex-legends) or let us know in the comments below. \n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n\nWe are aware that there\u2019s one issue where the game\u2019s performance will sometimes drop if the player makes changes to the graphics settings. The problem does not persist after a restart.  We are looking into this, but for now the recommended workaround is to just restart the game, which will allow you to keep your settings and get back to normal performance.\n\n### HOW TO TRY DX12\n\nA graphics card with a minimum DirectX Feature Level of 12\\_0 is required to launch the game with DX12. To determine your Feature Levels, open the Run dialog (Windows Key+R) and type \u201cdxdiag\u201d. Feature Levels are listed in the Drivers section of the Display tab.\n\n**EA App**\n\n1. From \u201cMy Collection\u201d, click on the three dots in the upper right corner of the Apex Legends tile and select \u201cView Properties\u201d\n2. Add \"-eac\\_launcher\\_settings SettingsDX12.json\" in the text box under \u201cAdvanced Launch Options\u201d\n3. Click \u201cSave\u201d and launch the game normally\n\n**Steam**\n\n1. From your library, right click Apex Legends, and select Properties\n2. Add \"-eac\\_launcher\\_settings SettingsDX12.json\" to \u201cLaunch Options\u201d\n3. Close the properties window and launch the game normally\n\n*For future updates, follow the*[ *Respawn Twitter account*](https://twitter.com/Respawn) *for the latest info or check out the* [*Apex Tracker Trello*](https://trello.com/b/ZVrHV38P/apex-tracker) *for bugs or concerns we\u2019re continuing to investigate.

We used to see the opposite for a while where weapons got gradually nerfed over time, but now it feels like we've seen a more radical pivot with Nemesis and R99.  C.A.R was stepping on R99 toes a bit too much. So instead of nerfing CAR they *buffed* R99 which feels very extreme given that it already was supposed to be the fastest TTK weapon in the game. Additionally with the introduction with the Nemesis it feels like they're setting the bar for TTK even lower, which is a rather sudden shift.\n\nAnother recent change that worryingly points towards that is the armor rarity nerf which makes me scratch my head a bit. Again, it's a discrete way of reducing time to kill.. so whats the devs endgame? The game has been built on long TTK for a while and now fairly recently they've been doing these more subtler changes to make dying be a bit faster. is this the developers agenda?

Hot dropping was a lot more punishing at the time, but going for high tier loot could change the odds in your favor. When the replicator came out i told my friends that it is balanced to keep batteries out because why craft a med kit which takes 8 seconds, when you can craft a battery which takes 5 and gives you up to 125 with red? Everything is equalized to the point where you can now down someone with a p2020 as easily as you can a flatline since it has barely any recoil and deals the same damage.\n\nDuring the early days it made sense for items like the gold backpack to have fast healing because the TTK was lower. Also, Evo shields were scattered across the map and you would have to find one. The damage to get to red was higher too, but when you did, that extra 25 armor affords you a longer TTK. Nowadays everyone has red and you can replicate more evo points than before.\n\nNowadays I personally don't care for the ever increasing TTK. Not just by managing the stats of the weapons, but through legend skills, and also by influencing the ways people have to/can play the game.

But the abuse kept happening, so they ditched the shield altogether. Now, her passive is good, but vanishingly useful (very rarely does reviving 2 teammates in a fight end up turning the tide of things, only slowing down the inevitable), her tactical is A tier, but her Ult is barely better than an assault class players Weapon Supply Bin. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the recent changes they made to her kit were great improvements; now that her drone has an unlimited \"pool\" of health and not 150hp, has better range, her ultimate doesn't take forever to drop, etc., she's climbed huge in terms of pickrate.

Strength is almost certainly borrowed from other parts of her kit to make this hyper rare, impractical feat possible. And unless she does have a gold knockdown, it's extremely unlikely that this double revive has any impact on a fight other than it taking longer to lose.

Mirage and Newcastle suffer from this same issue (and so does crypto, to an extent). Consider that you may be on a team with two very competent players, who largely only take damage into their shields, not their flesh. You can go entire games without using your passive, and only getting minimal utility from your tactical. That represents a HUGE disadvantage! Especially where your enemies could be using their passive abilities to jump around like Jack Russell Terriers, launch grenades across the map, outrun bullets, or literally just fucking *fly*. \n\nIn a game that so heavily rewards movement/gunplay/positioning/scanning, Lifeline still manages to bring value to the table.

The percentage of games players will FEEL like they lost for reasons outside of their control will skyrocket compared to team modes, and yeah, that's gonna suck for retention.

It's fine to get frustrated but you just keep pushing and let them feelings give you hunger to improve. I saw the comment below about playing zone, so I'm going to give you a tip from a guy that plays rank 15 hours consistently normally. So the first tip is, your comp matters if you don't have zone players then playing zone is not the way, I'm a edge player  btw and I feel like it's the best way to get elims and rank up easy. Though others will say zone is better which is neither is right or wrong it's all just playstyle, so you've to look at the comp your teammates have or you've.  Also even if you were playing a zone character nothing is wrong with swinging a early game fight just don't be in the dead center of any area without a escape route in your hand when shit goes south. So back to the edge/zone playing, you've to figure out what works best for you and if zone does work best pick a character that benefit from it like a Cat/Castle for example hold great defensive control. If you want to be a Zone player just remember getting a fight early game is your best friend and from there rotate on the outside wide of the map with cover, most people rush into zone too fast so that's why I play edge, not only that it forces you to think where people are not at so you learn to squeeze into spots naturally hence making you a better player for getting out of tight spots where you're held.

Bloodhound passive is different but very good as it does not have delay or rely on having any precise timing.\n\nTactical - After hoping you got someone lined up and use it, very easy to dodge. If you predicted good and shot your tactical anticipated where they'd move after you saw them on the scan, you'd get maybe 1 or 2. You still dont know where the 3rd is. Remember everyone and their mother half way across the map can hear the woosh woosh scan. If 1 of the enemy doesn' get scanned, all he has to do is wait, since most likely you who scanned is gonna push in knowing you can see them, the guy who didn't get scanned is gonna get you from an angle you didn't see on your scan.Bloodhound does it better here because - single tap get to know where and how many are there. Seer tactical giving you their shield info isn't that useful (you can get put down by 3 white armor enemies too)\n\nUltimate - You longer have diamonds on the enemies, but only have foot step marker - which are very very very hard to see, very useless.

Because players cling to easy characters and don\u2019t seek competition/skill. \n\nlol. that's conspiracy theory level of narrative without any evidence (even the fact that fuse isn't that highly picked to begin with).\n\n&gt;Even 3rd partying is worse because players only fight when they can 3rd party.\n\nIt's a battle royale., there's no such thing as third partying being bad or worse.\n\n&gt; it started because streamer complained and like the bots people are, they started using that excuse to cope\n\nagree. lot of gold mnk players complain getting killed by diamond controller players and somehow blame the input device for it when it's likely more to do with a better game understanding.\n\n&gt;The spitfire? lol better pray you one clip them or they\u2019ll keep shooting you. Why? Easy gun \n\nnot as bad as in the spitfire meta back then\n\n&gt;The players will make the game unfair and not fun for everyone because they use cheesy tactics then complain when the game lacks real skill lmao.\n\ntrue but it's the devs that make the rules, and players will minmax, so devs need to make sure the ruleset is sound. you can't blame players for minmaxing.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "lettuce_field_theory", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Post season 17 masters definitely, but a lot of players who made masters previously excluding season 12 are in my experience generally pretty good players.

Just frustrated with the nonsense being parroted in this subreddit.\n\nI'm in Diamond 2 at the moment and I got to diamond whilst not playing more than 4 hours 4 times a week and taking weeks off because of work.\n\nSo yeah take good fights, aggro when you have the damage diff advantage to be able to overwhelm toe opponent. Stick with your teammates and shoot stuff they shoot at and not be doing your own side quests. Communicate during games either via pings and via voice Comms.\n\nWork on what you can bring to the table for your team either a premade team or a cooked up trio from the lobby solo Queueing. Instead of the regular blaming teammates even for our own throws and mishaps.\n\nAnd you'd be doing swimmingly good provided your aim mechanics is worthy of being in the level you're. Yes it's grindey but I'd never want it to become a dumb decision Ranked System where everyone apes for simply no reason, dies 14rh with 6 kills and expect to rank up.

There are probably other nerfs with timing, but like I play causally, the tactical thing is the one that stood out to me. I don\u2019t think this is game breaking cuz I don\u2019t use seer rly, but when I tired him for the first time in many months I won two games in a row, and I only played two games with him so yeah.

Instead you misrepresent me saying that for instance Pathfinder's grapple activation is not instant as accusing you of saying others are instant. *That* is called a *strawman*.\n\nThis guy\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/16qc468/ok_im_gonna_say_it_wraiths_tactical_needs_a_buff/k1y1a65/\n\nyou haven't addressed either. just downvoted it seems (my guess).\n\nAlso my other comment here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/16qc468/ok_im_gonna_say_it_wraiths_tactical_needs_a_buff/k1z64ag/\n\nwhere I ask you what Rampart or Wattson have to do with how fast Wraith's tactical activates.\n\nWraiths abilities are balanced now. Your post is not convincing otherwise. Particularly as you forget that unlike most movement legends she's invincible for some time. Particularly as you suggest Wraith's tactical should cover lacking game sense and anticipation for newer players, by activating faster, no it shouldn't, they just need to improve at the game and learn when they are getting into a bad spot. Non movement characters would be knocked 10/10 times in situations where Wraith tactical still is able to bail her out even with the delay. Doesn't need a buff. \n\nYou can come up with coherent convincing counterargument or just dismiss everything as strawmen.

The issue is good cheats are very complex, if not impossible to catch. For instance, it's technically possible to scan each and every file on your computer to make sure you don't have a third party hack installed. But that would be a terrible legal infringement to your private life. From a practical standpoint, it would take forever to scan these files, and would have a huge impact on performances if keeping running that scan at runtime.\n\nHacks typically live in a zone where devs are powerless. The only easy hacks to detect are those modifying game files because you can diff them against the retail files. Third party programs and hardware devices, going between the game and the servers, are virtually impossible to detect on the software side. Hence why most game developers are moving from software scanning solutions to AI detection.\n\nDownvote me if that makes you feel better, but I'm a game dev myself, with experience in online games, and it really puzzles me to see comments about developers not caring about cheaters, especially when invoking greed.

{"post": {"title": "Okay, I\u2019m just throwing out some ideas I have regarding controller legends.", "subreddit": "apexlegends", "selftext": "Some of these have almost certainly been suggested before.\nThis is mostly just a post to say some of my ideas and get some conversation flowing.\nWhat changes do you think should be made to the controller legends. I have some ideas that probably aren\u2019t that great but my mind won\u2019t let me stop thinking about them until I post this.\nSo here are some terrible ideas.\n\nCatalyst:\nTrap either does less damage, or the slow is reduced dramatically.\nUltimate can be temporarily damaged by heavy weapons, creating small holes that let you see through it a little (definitely a terrible idea) \nTrap either can\u2019t go under doors, or does half the damage and slowing when it goes under a door.\nI also had another idea where instead of being able to reinforce doors, she can put traps on them that would still count as a placed trap, but would reinforce the door and have both sides covered in spikes. She would still be able to rebuild doors though.\nI think she should be able to destroy doors that she has reinforced by holding a button or just using a different button entirely.\nHer traps should be one shot because you have to be close to it anyway.\n\nCaustic:\nThe ability to kick placed traps or maybe roll them. I\u2019ll go in to detail about both options.\n\nRolling:\nRolling would allow caustic to either pick up a trap that he had placed and roll it, or maybe like rampart\u2019s ult where it\u2019s has a placement mode, you would have roll mode and place/throw mode. It would be similar to a slide where it has a large amount of momentum that dies off relatively quickly unless it has a hill to go down or something.\nI feel that it should get destroyed in one hit while it\u2019s moving. When it loses most of its momentum or when it gets near a player, it would go off. The trap would be too big to fit in windows.\n\nKicking:\nCaustic kicks an already placed trap, it would go about 10m on an entirely flat surface. Less than his normal throw, but with the plus that it\u2019s already prepared to gas ze enemies.\nIt would die in one shot when in motion, but would be normal when it lands.\n\nI also have another idea where his traps would have 200 health, but the cloud would increase in size, but decrease in damage and duration every 50 damage. With the biggest stage being as big as his ult but doing one damage and barely any slowing.\n\nGeneral buffs for caustic:\nI think his trap should have 100 health for the main part, or 50 at the bottom.\n\nWattson:\nI actually think Wattson is pretty fair, but I think her fences should do something to grenades, like making them explode a second later or decreasing their momentum by a large amount.\n\nRampart just got a buff so I\u2019ll keep these wild ramblings from the asylum to myself.", "ups": 0, "permalink": "/r/apexlegends/comments/16pozgc/okay_im_just_throwing_out_some_ideas_i_have/", "num_comments": 29}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I'm only on board if caustic voice line updates to say \"I'm rolling a variable\".\n\nBut for real, I would love the pre inflated gas traps.

{"post": {"title": "A critique on Apex ballistics and movement from an ex-Bungie tester", "subreddit": "apexlegends", "selftext": "# Preface\n\nI've been playing this game for three years, I freaking love it. And yes, I am an ex-Bungie, in-house sandbox tester and feel like I got a decent peek at how the sausage is made.\n\nThe following are just my opinions, man!\n\n# When new players come from other shooters\n\nYou see these posts everyday. \"I just tried Apex and can't hit sh\\*t! Any tips on how to improve?\" When I was starting I was in the same boat, sometimes I would empty a whole damn clip and hit 1-2 shots. I had been playing shooters for almost 20 years!\n\nI came from the likes of Halo, Destiny, CoD and Overwatch and feel like a certain amount of gun skill transferred between these games. In Apex, not so much.\n\nPersonally, the challenge intrigued me and I was motivated me to keep playing. For other players, I'm not so sure. I've tried to get many of my friends to try out Apex to no avail, they leave frustrated and just go back to CoD.\n\n**Here's a stack rank of factors** that I believe makes Apex ballistics and movement a bit too harsh. Altering them, even slightly, could make the game a bit better and more welcoming to new players.\n\n# Lack of strafe momentum\n\nIMO this is the biggest factor. In Apex Legends, when you switch directions during your strafe, you do so instantly. There is no preserved momentum that you have to fight in order to switch to the opposite direction.\n\nOverwatch and Halo Infinite (not a Bungie Halo) do this as well and it makes characters appear to have an unnatural weightlessness about them (watch a Reinhardt strafe sometime).\n\nThis makes tracking enemies much more difficult, especially up close when the parallax between players reaches extremes. This results in what I can only describe as break dance battles where you better have a good grip on your thumb stick if you don't want it to fly off.\n\nIt can get totally crazy when dealing with the likes of Bangalore and Mad Maggie when they have their movement buffs. I know Apex is the \"movement\" shooter but I really don't think adding some momentum would negate this title.\n\n# Crouching while strafing\n\nThere is no penalty to movement speed when crouching until your character fully bends their knees. You can throw crouches into your strafe at any point without losing speed as long as you immediately stand back up.\n\nThis compounds the aforementioned break dance battles and leads to wild sideways-S-shaped strafing patterns that are just a bit too much.\n\nCrouching should immediately incur some kind of movement penalty.\n\n# Low bullet magnetism aka bullet diameter\n\nApex has practically none of this. The biggest outlier I can think of is Vantage's sniper rifle round which is the size of a football.\n\nDestiny has a ton of bullet magnetism and is the main reason it's so easy to hit your shots. I actually think it has a bit too much but it is why it feels so friggin' gooey (in a good way).\n\nIf time-to-kill is a function of shot accuracy and bullet damage, I see a scenario where slightly increasing magnetism and slightly decreasing bullet damage leads to the same TTK but you are hitting more of your shots.\n\nHitting shots feels good, feeling good keeps new players around.\n\n# Recoil smoothing\n\nNow this is a strange one, moving your reticle above a certain speed reduces recoil. While it totally helps you to hit your shots, it is an extremely cryptic and counter-intuitive game mechanic that I only learned about after delving down the depths of Apex related Youtube videos.\n\nIt leads to another bizarre mechanic known as jitter-aiming (at least on MnK) where rapidly jittering your reticle actually makes bullets shoot perfectly straight. I'm not saying to reduce or remove recoil smoothing but maybe it could be added in the tutorial for new players?\n\n\"Strafing while shooting will reduce weapon recoil\" sounds super strange but holy crap it's important to know.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe goal is to preserve Apex's \"movement shooter\" spirit while making it a bit easier for new players to pick up. \"Easy to learn, hard to master\" is a key principle in game design and I don't think the previously mentioned changes to movement would impact that spirit.\n\nDrawing from my Bungie experience, where never sacrificing game feel was the credo, hitting shots feels ***good,*** not hitting shots feels bad.\n\nI believe making it a bit easier for players to hit their shots will ultimately increase the transferability from the likes of CoD, Overwatch, Destiny, etc. and keep newer players around.\n\nI know this is a long ass post but I'm really wondering what y'all think. Have you had any trouble onboarding new friends to Apex Legends? Would altering any of these things destroy Apex as we know it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...Anyways, excuse me while I get back to the range and practice hitting my damn shots.", "ups": 0, "permalink": "/r/apexlegends/comments/16pnmdn/a_critique_on_apex_ballistics_and_movement_from/", "num_comments": 11}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Agree with near everything except for the bullet magnetism.\n\nApex is one of the only games where I know that \"I\" am hitting all my shots.

Why train to counter the patterns? Just tapdance.\n\nEither reduce all recoil to the level it's at while smoothing so it doesn't matter whether you tapdance (easy to implement, probably), or just remove the mechanic and reduce the recoil to a level that's manageable but still requires some semblance of actual recoil control (harder to implement, alienating to controller players, literal pipe dream).", "ups": 0, "depth": 0, "author": "Schadenfreude11", "replies": [{"selftext": "You know, you are making a lot of sense!

When I want to play and land hot it would be inconsiderate to do that in rank.  That's throwing my teammates games and that's not cool.

Again it is Respawn's and EA's responsibility to find ways to keep players engaged.  Forcing LTM's into an existing playlist isn't cool imo.  I'm happy people get to play a map that they have missed in a format that they enjoy.  I don't enjoy it and it has forced me off the game until it ends.

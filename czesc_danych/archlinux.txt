The flickering is rectangular and presents itself for a fraction of a second, taking up maybe about 1/8th of the screen or so.

I have yet to try anything on wayland but I plan to soon just to see if there are any noteworthy observations.\n\nAn interesting thing I noticed is that almost everyone reporting this issue is running a Turing architecture card. The flickering occurs much less often when I switch the powermizer in nvidia settings to prefer maximum performance, but that in turn also makes my card draw a steady 50w lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've tried to just deal with it, but it kind of drives me insane.

They even supply custom compiled versions of Proton using the optimized system libs.\n\nThe actual performance gains you'll get from this aren't mind blowing, but they are there. Things are just a little more snappy and smooth. I feel like the custom Proton handles heavy loads like Cyberpunk 2077 a little bit better.

No one single thing is going to blow your mind, but the cumulative effect of all the software being optimized leads to a really smooth experience.\n\nIf you're looking for something Arch based but with something improves on Arch rather than just making it faster to install maybe give it a shot.

Some stay closer to Arch than others and that is  another thing to consider.\n\nOften, other than theming, the main difference is the installer. Once installed, Arch is no longer any more difficult to maintain.  The resistance to making the distro easier to install is a philosophy that we have to accept or go elsewhere. In my view, archinstall is a step in the right direction. Not perfect, but a step in the right direction.\n\nBefore all the Arch based distros and archinstall there were other unofficial installers such as the install script archfi (arch fast installer) and even now there are installers that use calamares to install a stock Arch system (calam arch installer).\n\nSure, it is best to do the wiki install so that you understand the system, but when you need a fast install it is nice to have a script such as archinstall (or others).

I will leave cleaning up for other people. Instead I'll explain the other option. If your partitions are xfs you cannot shrink your xfs partitions so the only way you could increase the size would be if you are willing to delete a partition (the swap partition is usually a good candidate). If you run ext4 and you're not using lvms you can download gparted and do it graphically, but beware of data loss! If you use lvms and ext4 you use lvreduce and lvextend with --resizefs option and while people warn of data loss, my experience is that this method is very safe.\n\nThis is the partition scheme I recommend for separate home:\n100 MiB + 200 MiB FAT32 boot partition per linux kernel (using systemd-boot).\n50 - 100 GiB lvm ext4 root partition.\nThe rest should be your lvm ext4 home partition.\n\nI think there are benefits to have a separate home because all your user data is stored in /home so it's very easy to purge root and reinstall everything if you'd want, or if you'd distrohop. If you don't care about the rest of your files but want to keep your user configurations you could do a /home/$USER/.config partition instead. You could try to set it to 3 - 5 GiB.\n\nOf course a singular root partition is much simpler and saves you the headache of having to manage disk space between partitions.\n\nAlso I recommend against making a swap partition for the simple reason that it's easier to manage a swap file. You can delete it if you need space or resize it if your needs change. While you can also do that on LVMs, the swapfile method is easier in my opinion.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "Maleficent-Path-6909", "replies": [{"selftext": "I agree. Indeed there are very good reasons for keeping /home as a separate partition.\n\n - You may want to use ext4 for root and btrfs (et al) for home.\n - You may want to encrypt /home and not root. Providing protections for personal information.\n - While root typically gets some space leeway, it still can be quite nasty to have users fill root partition - bad things can definitely still happen.\n\nMy own goto schema is 2GB for EFI, 100GB for root and the remainder for home. A bit more system generous than u/Maleficent-Path-6909. As of today, I prefer btrfs for home and ext4 for root. \n\nIn addition to the suggestions, its pretty easy to bind mount stuff onto other partitions - if root is under pressure and home is not, then move cache to home, delete from root and bind mount it back. Or use symlinks - but you may prefer bind mounts.\n\ngene", "ups": 2, "depth": 1, "author": "gcgc101", "replies": []}]}]}

{"post": {"title": "Subject: Boot Loaders", "subreddit": "archlinux", "selftext": "Hello r/archlinux,\n\nI am here this time seeking guidance on the topic of boot loaders.\n\nOn the wiki it seems that out of the specified categories Grub is the only one that satisfies all areas of the listed categories. Grub however doesn't support LUKS2, only LUKS1. I read on some forums that there are some hacky work-arounds for using LUKS2 on Grub; I want as secure of a system as I can have, without having a hardened linux kernel, (as I want to use LVM;) so this means no hacky work-arounds that would be hard to keep track of and audit.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTANGENT:\n\nWould someone please provide resources for why the Hardened Linux Kernel doesn't support the features that it doesn't support, (and what they are?) Especially any real world examples of attack vectors due to poor configuration.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBACK TO MAIN DISCUSSION:\n\nWhat fully featured, currently maintained, stable boot loaders would the arch community recommend I use? I want to use file system level encryption. Some of the boot loaders in the wiki say they don't support file system level encryption. Does this mean they don't have the ability to unlock those containers / decrypt the data, or does this mean that if you are using that boot loader then you can't have file system level encryption at all?  A suitable option for me based on the official wiki may be systemd-boot, only, what does it mean by \"[side-loaded](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process#Feature_comparison)\" and how do you do that? (The search engine I use sometimes doesn't give very accurate or relevant results, and this is one of those occasions. My apologies.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT:\n\nI am planning on having multiple encrypted partitions (home, swap, root), that I would like to unlock all at the same time, I know that systemd-boot supports this, so I am leaning into choosing systemd-boot as my boot loader, I am also planning on using LVM on top of (home, root) those encrypted partitions. \n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA CREDIT:\n\nCan someone provide resources, (however outdated,) on memory exploits employed before the W\\^X policy? I understand the concept, writing cpu instructions in a part of memory, (RAM,) intended for some program or data, and then getting that to execute. It sounds like process injection, is it something different? I would like some study materials on actual attacks that were used, or theorized attacks but with actual source code; So that I can overall gain a better understanding of using memory securely, and keeping it protected / lowering it's attack surface in my machines. Thank you in advance, and if you assume all materials on memory exploits and vulnerabilities are welcome, you are correct, as I am very curious and very ignorant when it comes to errors / faults / dumps / vulnerabilities etc. in memory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT:\n\nI read a wikipedia article that talked about executing files and I realized I may have made this more complicated than it needed to be, is it simply just editing a file that already exists that has some permissions, and then executing the program?\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCLOSING:\n\nThank you in advance to all who take the time to respond and attempt to help me learn and further me in my journey of successfully installing Arch.\n\n    #!/bin/sh\n    echo \"Arch is the best!\"", "ups": 2, "permalink": "/r/archlinux/comments/16pvcpf/subject_boot_loaders/", "num_comments": 15}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Do you need/want encryption for the boot partition itself?

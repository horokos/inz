Still prone to irritation. \n\n**Products**\n\nI've added extra moisturisers that are heavier.\n\nWhilst I'm not really using more products than this time last year, they aren't gels anymore.\n\nI was using Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Water sleeping mask and Hada Labo Perfect Gel a lot, plus some others, with Illiyoon ATO Ceramide Concentrate cream over the top for my neck.\n\nNow, every single cream I use, apart from Illiyoon, has shea butter in for my neck and we're talking 3-4 creams on average generally.\n\nFor my face, I happened to start an experiment with Whoo products which happened to be so much more moisturising and this is now my bare minimum that works! \n\nI've gone back to my previous HGs - Sooryehan Bon Firming cream, Sooryehan Hyobidam Fermented Emulsion, Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Water sleeping mask - and they do not work in my new location. I find the Sooryehan isn't moisturising enough and the Isntree, even over my shea butter creams, dries out my neck.\n\nI had to get a body lotion to address dryness, previously I'd only used a glycolic acid moisturiser on my arms but now they're crying out for an actual moisturiser.\n\nI also started using an oil cleanser as a body wash! \n\nUnfair Finger kindly suggested a chelating product that's also very hydrating so I hope this will help my face and offset some of the effects of hard water. It's the Plodica Re Wake Moist Treatment Toner and should arrive in a few days.\n\nMy previous HG toner, Whoo Gongjinhyang Seol Radiant White balancer seems to dry my face out now and even my other HG, Sooryehan Hyobidam Fermented Toner isn't helping as much as I'd hoped \ud83d\ude1e", "ups": 51, "permalink": "/r/AsianBeauty/comments/16rkv7t/my_experience_of_decreased_humidity_hard_water/", "num_comments": 33}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I feel this!

Super pleasant for hot days in my opinion.|\n|The hydration is not the best or long-lasting. Perfect for oily skin or for those who don't like the heaviness of cream on their face during summer.|Hydration lasts until next morning. Face looks bouncy and elastic.|\n\n(\\*) Please, note I'm horrible describing scents that aren't strong enough or don't remind me of anything in particular. Both products had a neutral and unexciting smell, which personally I enjoyed.\n\nThese are my final and extended thoughts:\n\n\ud83c\udf3f**iUnik Centella Calming Gel Cream**\ud83c\udf3f\n\n* For summer, I like that it absorbs quickly because I don't like on hot nights the feeling of a heavy moisturizing (although I must say I'm the type of person who likes waking up with a dewy face due to the moisturizer...).\n* The product almost dries immediately once you spread it well on the face.\n* I think the centella has helped calm and soothe my skin, I don't know if it's just my perception, but it also reduced the texture of pimples (??)\n* I don't like that the packaging is so small.\n* It doesn't moisturize me enough. It's perfect for the heat, but falls short if you need more than a light overnight gel.\n* My dehydrated skin-tendecy doesn't like this gel very much. Sometimes, when I'm more dehydrated than usual, it tends to make my face feel a bit tight. When this happens, I combine it with the Beta Glucan serum of the same brand ([already did a review about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/13iafys/beta_glucan_power_moisture_serum_iunik/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)).\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f  I like this cream, it's very lightweight, and it's perfect for high temperatures because you don't sweat with it. It also doesn't stick to your hair, which is a strange but interesting detail... It dries quickly and has a non-sticky finish. It's not matte but not dewy either, the skin looks natural. I would buy it again because I really like how my skin reacts to centella. But if I find a moisturizer that is more hydrating than this one but with equally good results, I would switch. The one thing I hate most is that it provides only 1/3 of the hydration I need... And also, this past uses, the iUnik gel cream gave me like a tightness sensation that caused me discomfort. It is true, though, since it's no longer summer and weather has been not has hot, my face likes a more hydrating moisturising. So probably that's just my face asking for more.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **3.75/5**. I wish it came in a larger size (this is an easy fix, Iunik: give us jar-sized moisturizers) and I wish it hydrated more than it does (but this is personal because I like waking up the next day with some residue of the moisturizer still on my face).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\ud83e\uded8**Beauty of Joseon Red Bean Water Gel**\ud83e\uded8\n\n* I've been alternating between BoJ and iUnik during the summer, and this BoJ cream seemed perfect for me. I liked that it was lightweight yet hydrating, and the next day I could feel my skin moisturized without any tightness.\n* I don't mind that it takes a bit longer to absorb because the sensation on my face is not bothersome. It's gentle and refreshing.\n* I haven't noticed any additional effects besides hydration from the gel cream, but that doesn't bother me since I wasn't looking for a treatment, just hydration for the night.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f As a final comment, I love this cream. It's lightweight, gentle, moisturizing, and the packaging is beautiful. I really have nothing negative to say about it; it has truly met all my expectations, and I'll definitely be using it again next summer.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **5/5**.  I really have nothing negative to say about this cream; it meets all my needs, and I haven't experienced any side effects from it (unlike the iUnik one, which, as I mentioned, wasn't hydrating enough, and many nights I could feel my face getting tight).   \n\n\n\\*\\* I don't have any videos showing the texture of the products because the gel creams are currently in different places. If you'd like to see them, I'll upload a new post with the texture and talk more about them. In the video, you'll be able to see the \"runny\" texture of iUnik and the firmness of the BoJ cream perfectly.

First test of the infection block (irony is not lost on me that I ended up with a MSSA infection the first week of the infection block). It was also the first test I activated my testing accommodations (low-stimulus environment). It was lovely- I was by myself in the program coordinator's office (my backpack and all my items were in the academic dean's office), and so I was able to turn off the lights and be in relative silence without the shuffling of people around me. 10/10, so much reduced anxiety and I felt way more able to \"be\" in class after.\n\nI'm also remarkably consistent on my exams. Somehow, 6/7 of these tests, I've missed the exact same # of questions (the other test was after Pride and I was so overstimulated I was not doing well).

I did almost nothing last week. Honestly, after the infection + feeling sick, and having more of the clinical med stuff, and having louder lecturers, and generally just being more over-stimulated and over-people'd... plus I can just tell I'm getting depressed again... I just couldn't bring myself to do much other than rest. I napped with Oreo, binge-watched the last season of Sex Education, watched Elemental, played stupid phone games while listening to 2.5 books... It was so nice. And it's nice to still do just as well as usual without putting in the effort.\n\nSpeaking of the infection- I'm almost done with my abx course (yay), but I'm a little worried it's not working 100%. I was told the culture showed sensitivity to the bactrim I'm on (even though it's not first line for the bacteria), and my scalp is still flaring. I switched out all the bedding (washed the old sheets on hot and dried on hot too). I also got more hibiclens since I wasn't given any topical abx to help, and I used it two nights ago so fingers crossed it'll help.

Significantly more moisturizing than the Hydro Barrier Cream, but slightly less hydrating.\n- **Packaging:** I like the ease of the pop-off cap top, but I also find it\u2019s easy to squeeze out a bit too much. I used a chickpea-sized amount the first time and it was way too much since I only need the tiniest amount of product. \n- **Wear:** Super comfortable, medium weight. It leaves a bit a slight barrier layer on the skin for a bit, but it\u2019s not as heavy or persistent as the Illiyoon, and it\u2019s not sticky as the Hydro Barrier Cream.

HELP!!!", "ups": 9, "depth": 0, "author": "nofishsauce", "replies": [{"selftext": "This was me at the beginning of this year and also sometimes still me now! I'm much better with impulsive skincare purchases, makeup not so much \ud83d\ude43. But BABY STEPS! Also, this ended up being an essay so apologies in advance.\n\nI began with unsubscribing from all the emails \u2013 olive young, jolse, stylekorean and yesstyle so I wouldn't even be tempted. Now I'm just keeping things in my cart and waiting until they're the absolute lowest I've ever seen them. (example: I had the mude blushes in my cart from when they launched however long ago, maybe a year ago? That let me see what the discount usually was and also how often they'd be discounted and where. I didn't pull the trigger until a year later when they were finally under $10.)\n\nAlso, having an excel or notion with your current routine and updating that every so often helps, so you can keep track of what your routine is and see what works/what doesn't. Mine also includes when I opened the product and when I finished it so I know how long it takes me to finish things and reminds me that NO I DON'T NEED THIS BECAUSE SEE \u2013 IT TOOK ME LITERALLY 5 MONTHS TO FINISH THIS TONER etc.\n\nI also made a notion with my entire inventory \u2013 complete with when I bought it, when it arrived, the expiration date, when I opened it, when I finished it, if I gave it away/etc. And I also periodically (once a quarter) take everything out and reorganize it and take a picture so I remind myself exactly how big my collection is and why I don't need to buy anything. Taking everything out is also helpful because I need to SEE things otherwise I very much have that \"out of sight out of mind\" mentality. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wsdqm651r8qb1.png?width=2542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c5f5871879b20675b5c2004cf582b4b08e58db\n\nI also have a wishlist in my notes section for when I really want something, and honestly I think I've only bought maybe 4 items from that entire list. It helps with my impulsive purchases \u2013 plus, when I do purchase, it's usually because that product is on sale and like super low (like when the amuse dew tints were like $7 so I just bought any on my list vs all of the colors).\n\nAnd, I ended up repurposing one of my book carts (those three-tiered carts) for skincare and makeup \u2013 so now I can see all of my makeup and my backup skin products for when my current routine runs out. My current one is on a lazy susan on my bedside table. Then everything else is in bins but stacked in a corner of my room so I know it's there and full. It's a nice reminder that I already have a ton of stuff and really don't need any more.\n\nFinally, like everybody else said \u2013 make sure none of your cards are stored for easy purchasing! Ofc, it doesn't work if you're like me and memorized your credit card information, but it's still a step that helps. And have an accountability buddy! I found my most successful no-spend months were when I did the challenge with a friend and we had strict rules and both checked with each other when we wanted to buy something, like we needed each other's permission. And if we did buy something, it needed to be for a reason \u2013 like her dog chewed through her collar so she needed to buy a new one was approved, but me being lazy and wanting to buy takeout instead of cooking with my full fridge was not.\n\nONE MORE THING! As someone else said, r/MakeupRehab and r/PanPorn are both great for working on curbing those impulsive purchases \u2013 MUR has a bunch of really great challenges so you actually work through your stash, and panporn helps by seeing how long it really takes to pan makeup.\n\nGood luck!!

It shortens the time needed to apply the sunscreen too. It is also super moisturizing. Depending on your skin type and preferences this could be a good or bad thing.

My niece doesn't have that concern at the moment.*\n\n**Serum: Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid**  \n\\-honestly the best budget serum for hyperpigmentation in the market at the moment  \n\\-Other budget alternatives: ***Rohto Melano CC Anti-Spot Essence*** *if you have the patience as this takes longer to take effect than Tranexamic Acid BUT this essence does have brightening effects that the TN acid doesn't have.*\n\n**Moisturizer: Pyunkang Yul Intensive Ceramide Lotion**  \n\\-comes in 500ml  \n\\-This works great for her as a body lotion as well  \n\\-Other budget alternatives: ***Naturie Hatomugi Skin Conditioning Gel*** *in the 180g tub or* ***Hada Labo All In One Perfect Gel*** *in the 100g tub; but surprisingly PYK is the cheapest from where she is)*\n\n**Sunscreen: Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel**  \n\\-This can be a Moisturizer+Sunscreen for AM if you really want to save money and time (one less step!)  \n\\-A lot of the cheap sunscreens available are purely spf and not hydrating enough.

It took me a good 4-5 years to realize it became curly lol. I would start by ditching your shampoo (which I assume is likely a big brand name and theres a sulfate listed as the 1st or 2nd ingredient on the back) and switching to something sulfate free. There's a whole updated list of 'curly girl approved' products (i.e. products free of sulfates/silicones/parabens/etc) online. Start deep conditioning in the shower with something heavy duty that is also sulfate(some conditioners have sulfate too, which is crazy)/silicone free and low protein. Then put in a leave in conditioner once you get out of the shower.

I switched my routine over 2 years ago and my hair is *still* getting healthier/curlier as I figure out the best routine.\n\nAlmost forgot to add the most important thing: do not brush it when its dry. If your hair is curly or wavy and you're brushing it dry, you're shooting yourself in the foot and breaking up all the clumps that are trying to come together and become curls. And whatever you break up when its dry will stay separated and become *frizz.*\n\nDetangle in the shower with your fingers, have it fully detangled, and then brush it *WET* to line everything up. And the brush does not serve the purpose here as a detangler, but as a tool to manipulate your hair into the dry hairstyle. I.e. clump it in a certain pattern. Your hair is very fragile when wet, and putting force on it will stretch out the strands and damage them. That brush should have 0 resistance moving through your hair.

I think the stress of being touched during our physical exam skills workshops + some other BS stuff that\u2019s happened recently just wore me down more than usual.\n\nI also usually stop doing skincare when I flare like this because I worry about using skincare tools and those getting colonized and then spreading infection more.

It was always cheap, relatively speaking for the quality you'd get. Whereas it was considered a little small luxury where I lived. Not $60 per cream luxury but still to have a line of skincare as a teenager was still expensive and the skincare wasn't that great per price in comparison.\nIn Korea and Japan, skincare is just something everyone did/does, it's been a thing for awhile, it's cheap, and widely accessible and the cultural emphasis on having good skin is just important. (Like how facemasks even back then were 50 cents to $1 USD, for example. Or a really good moisturizer was $8. Whereas on par with face masks (at the time) was $5 a piece and moisturizer was $12 and not as elegant or formula driven). I assume it's the same since 2008 to now. Having something widely accessible and time to research and a culture that emphasizes sunscreen, skincare and taking care of your skin, I believe these are all ways that has made skincare on average, cheaper to having a complete/buy a line of skincare for men and women, teens alike. That popularity also gives rise to experimentation. Also, I have been using snail mucin since the 2000s. It's \"disgusting\" (at the time at least) in the west but wildly open in eastern cultures. So when you are more open to experimentation as well with ingredients, and you have a demand from men and women, you have more opportunities to make something great. Also Japanese brands (were) and still are known for basic, working ingredients. Nothing too complicated but they work.

Is it a matter of increased demand, more reasonable markups, something else?*\n\n**There are many reasons for this:**\n\nKorean skincare has best skincare technology in the world,  encouraged, enabled, and subsidized by the government of Korea. Korean products, especially skin care, are seen as the most high-tech out there by pretty much every cosmetics expert \u2014 Lanc\u00f4me even credited the country\u2019s advancements in featherweight foundation when it launched its own [Miracle Cushion foundation](http://www.thecut.com/2015/04/summer-foundation-that-wont-melt-off-your-face.html).\n\n(Under U.S. law, cosmetic products and ingredients do not need FDA approval before they go on the market. Other than subjecting colors used in food, drugs and cosmetics to FDA review, cosmetics law has not changed in 80 years\u2014since the *Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act* was passed in 1938. However this is [*finally*](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-laws-regulations/modernization-cosmetics-regulation-act-2022) going to change.)\n\nThe Korean government \"has a close relationship with the Korean International Trade Association (KITA), a nonprofit group that helps small-to-medium-size Korean companies break into the U.S. market by introducing them to American retailers and distributors. It also coaches them on pricing, the amount of stock they need to have to sell in the U.S., and how to package their products to appeal to buyers here.\n\nIn Korea, the government gives tax breaks to export-only companies, like Wishtrend, a four-year-old Korean beauty company that sells only to the U.S. \u2014 it [doesn\u2019t have to](https://www.thecut.com/2015/09/korean-beauty-and-the-government.html) pay taxes in the country at all.\"\n\nOne of Korea's best beauty products is Korean sunscreen combined with skincare options and far cheaper than US brands. Their sunscreens are so good they can be used as primers and often are these days even by professional makeup artists, with features such as tints, color correctors, dewy/matte finishes built into the sunscreen.\n\nKorean skincare is cheaper than other brands also because their products are manufactured in Korea. Manufacturing costs are lower in Korea. Producing them domestically allows companies to avoid importing pricey foreign materials. Examples are Laneige, Isntree, Dr Jart, Corsx, Purito, Etude House, &amp; Beauty of Joseon.\n\nKorean skin care's cost-effectiveness is also attributed to the sleek and minimalist packaging it boasts. Unlike Western beauty brands that often indulge in elaborate packaging to entice customers, Korean beauty brands prioritize the quality of the product itself over showy packaging. They focus on skincare prevention over reaction.\n\nThe Korean skincare industry is much more heavily regulated than its Western counterpart. In Korea, all skincare products must undergo rigorous testing and approval by the Korea Food and Drug Administration before they can be sold to consumers. This ensures that only the safest and most effective products are made available to the public.\n\nSome excellent YouTube channels on Korean Beauty are:\n\n[Odile Monod - The Monodist](https://www.youtube.com/@OdileMonodTheMonodist)\n\n[Beauty Within](https://www.youtube.com/@BeautyWithin)\n\n[Tina Tanaka Harris](https://www.youtube.com/@TinaTanakaHarris)\n\n[EuniUnni](https://www.youtube.com/@EuniUnni/videos)", "ups": 560, "depth": 0, "author": "spireup", "replies": [{"selftext": "Holy crap you\u2019re amazing where are all your upvotes c\u2019mon everybody hurry up", "ups": 53, "depth": 1, "author": "SailorMercurehh", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Amazing write-up!

There is a maximum number of physical faces no matter how many products there are or how much they buy.\n\nMany Korean beauty companies don't even sell their products in Korea. And Koreans use some Western products too.\n\nThe  economy of scale here is they leverage their large scale of production to achieve lower costs, greater bargaining power, and more resources for innovation. This has allowed them to compete effectively in the global market and to produce high-quality products at affordable prices.\n\nThe larger the scale of production, the lower the cost per unit.\n\n**The largest Korean beauty company is Amorepacific.** It was founded in 1945 and is now one of the world's leading cosmetics companies, with a presence in over 40 countries. **Amorepacific owns a portfolio of over 30 brands, including Laneige, Sulwhasoo, Etude House, and Innisfree.**\n\nAmorepacific benefits from volume and technology in a number of ways. First, its large scale of production allows it to negotiate lower prices for raw materials and packaging. This helps to reduce the cost of goods sold and improve profitability. Second, Amorepacific invests heavily in research and development, which allows it to develop new products and technologies. This helps to keep the company ahead of the competition and to meet the changing needs of consumers.\n\nHere are some specific examples of how Amorepacific benefits from volume and technology:\n\n* Amorepacific has developed a number of patented technologies, such as the \"Micro Moisture Capsule\" and the \"Hydro Ion Mineral Water.\" These technologies are used in a variety of Amorepacific products, including Laneige's Water Bank Hydro Essence and Sulwhasoo's First Care Activating Serum.\n* Amorepacific uses robotics and automation to improve the efficiency of its production and logistics operations. This helps to reduce costs and improve quality.\n\nOverall, Amorepacific's focus on volume and technology has been a key driver of its success. By investing in research and development and by using the latest technologies, Amorepacific has been able to develop innovative products that meet the needs of consumers around the world.\n\nAs for consumers, most Koreans don't use so many steps:\n\n&gt;\"10 products doesn't mean you have a ten step routine. In my case just for my face alone I have 7 products minus the sunscreens for my face but usually i only use 4 of them everyday. The other 3 are there for additional boosts and treatments. In addition I also have 3 sunscreens for different occasions so there that too\"\u2014msk-qp6fn\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"Korean here. The 10-step routine is out of fashion now as yes, people have realized that it's a marketing ploy and are moving on to more minimal routines (\"skincare diet\"). Essences, serums, ampules all do the same thing in just varying ratios of water/oil and you definitely don't need to use them all.\"\u2014blebintheinterweb\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;My understanding of the 10 step was not that one person needs all 10 or uses all 10 at once. It's more of a categorizing method and you can mix and match whatever you feel like you need more of. Skin feeling a little dehydrated? Add another hydrating layer. Skin feeling a little rough? Try a peeling gel. Skin feeling delicate? Cut back and just wash, tone, moisturize. And so on. Some people may not ever need an essence or serum in addition to their toner and moisturizer. Some people need all of them every time. Some people just need it once in a while for some extra help. Also Korean layers tend to be much lighter than western layers, across the board.\u2014throwitawayinashoebx\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;For me, I always took the 10 steps as a \"suggestion\" more than a definite rule that I had to follow to a T. I used it as a guide (like how products should be layered and such) and took out things that I felt my skin didn't really need.\u2014NoodleEmpress\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"most Koreans hyper focus on the cleanse and hydration parts of the routine, so it won't inherently be 10 products but it could be 10 steps like layering a toner a few times to bring the moisture back and then following with a moisturizer and sunscreen.\"\u2014kireikiku\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The 10 Step Korean Skin Care Routine Is Not Real (And Never Was)**\n\n&gt;**\"The first appearance of the term \u201c10 Step Korean Skincare\u201d can be traced back to an article published in** ***American*** **beauty magazine Into The Gloss in April 2014.** In the article K-Beauty expert Charlotte Cho introduces readers to some popular Korean skincare product categories that are not available in the US, while explaining how to layer these formulas and build a skincare routine.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Charlotte Cho** is a Korean-American entrepreneur and co-founder of **Soko Glam**, an American website founded in 2012 with the mission of bringing Korean beauty products to a Western audience. Cho rose to international fame in 2015, when she published\u00a0\u201c**The Little Book of Skin Care**\u201d, the first English-language book dedicated to Korean beauty.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the book she explains once again how to create a skincare using 10 popular Korean products and dubs this practice as the \u201c10 Step Korean Skincare Routine\u201d. **Although the author never openly states that Koreans actually follow this elaborate routine, the book implicitly suggests that was how Korean skincare was designed to work.** Shortly after the publication of \u201cThe Little Book of Skin Care\u201d, Western media outlets picked up the story and created a mythology around the \u201c10 Step Skincare Ritual that Koreans are obsessed with\u201d and that\u2019s why, in the mind of many foreigners, the \u201c10 Step Korean Skincare Routine\u201d is still considered synonymous with Korean beauty to this day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To be fair, **Cho has always been very open about the fact that the \u201c10 Step Korean Skin Care Routine\u201d was something she came up with** and in many interviews she candidly admits the \u201c10 Step Skin Care Routine\u201d was never an actual thing in Korea.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that she\u2019s still a business owner who sells 10 Step Korean skincare starter kits on her website, so even though she\u2019s always been very transparent about the nature of this routine, it\u2019s hard to imagine she was too pressed about dispelling the myth. \u2014[The 10 Step Korean Skin Care Routine Is Not Real (And Never Was)](https://themonodist.com/2021/10/26/the-10-step-korean-skin-care-routine-is-not-real-and-never-was/), [*The Modonist*](https://themonodist.com/2021/10/26/the-10-step-korean-skin-care-routine-is-not-real-and-never-was/)", "ups": 28, "depth": 2, "author": "spireup", "replies": [{"selftext": "There\u2019s almost 52 million people in South Korea.

Maybe it is also historically like this because a lot of Asian countries had their breakthrough later than a lot of western countries and had cheaper prices because of that and the consumers now don't want to accept much higher prices for the same product and other brands have to follow there or they won't be bought that much?", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "Designer-Reward8754", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Why don't all Korean/Japanese brands not officially partner with Indian platforms?

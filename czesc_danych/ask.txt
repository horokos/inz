As a parent of one teen and two younger ones, the options just aren\u2019t there\u2026 I\u2019m the mean parent for limiting screen time/not giving them phones, so many neighbor kids never leave their house because they just game all day or their parents don\u2019t want to let their kids run in packs in our (safe) neighborhood, and a lot of kids are seeing shit they definitely should not be seeing on the internet and sharing it all over school for edgelord points.\n\nBasically, what made the 90s great to me was it was probably the last time that you could regularly discover new things out in the wild regularly. Today, the answer to anything is a click away, which somewhat robs the world of the journey. \n\nAs a side note, I think people who are part of the MAGA monolith today were much more tolerable then. We didn\u2019t really have \u201cnews\u201d stations crafting ongoing, complex narratives that people glommed on to, so it was just my nutty uncle with some weird views then\u2026 now he\u2019d be parroting Fox News word for word. Social justice work felt more clean cut back then\u2026 of course race/gender/sexuality shouldn\u2019t be the result of discrimination, whereas today, in spite of my \u201cas long as it isn\u2019t doing harm to others, carry on\u201d approach to life, the battles today are much more muddy\u2026 I\u2019m fine with people wanting to identify however they want, and I don\u2019t necessarily care or need to know the why no matter how much you want to make your personal experience one that everyone else must understand. \n\nLastly, and this is a double edged sword, but while mental health was likely underrepresented in mass culture, today feels a little extreme to me. I\u2019ve met so many teens and 20s kids who have just given themselves permission to not improve because of their undiagnosed adhd, autism, etc. those things used to be a reason people had challenges\u2026 it seems much for acceptable today for people to use those as a reason to not try to improve/overcome. \n\nBroad stroke statements for sure, but observations from a data point of one.", "ups": 11, "depth": 0, "author": "Snoo30715", "replies": [{"selftext": "Best post ever", "ups": 1, "depth": 1, "author": "KoRaZee", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Nice comment", "ups": 1, "depth": 1, "author": "TheWalkingDadJoke", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "They weren\u2019t bad years not as good as the eighties and definitely not as good as the seventies.", "ups": 4, "depth": 0, "author": "Intelligent-North957", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "I mean, the 90s (in the US) also had the Bush era and the Gulf War.

I would say hi and nothing. It wasn't hard for me to figure out what happened. I still had the letter she gave me so every day I walked into school with my head held high and waited. What made it worse is that in middle school I was bullied by both students and teachers and spent most of my middle school years completely alone and isolated. I had worked my ass off getting out from under what I refer to my 3 years of hell. I was also dealing with abuse issues at home. It felt like I was thrown right back to square one again.  I knew my friends well enough that they couldn't keep the silent treatment up forever. Someone would eventually say something to me. So I waited and the next Friday one of my friends started yelling at me in the hallway. I didn't react just let her scream while I sat my bookbag down and got the origional letter out and handed it to her. She started reading it and her eyes got big then said sorry, fon't worry about it I will handle it. By monday I had all my friends back and she was basically a social pariah. \n\nI regret how I handled the whole thing. Several months later I found out the real reason for the origional letter.

Give yourself the first couple of weeks to observe and look for her. You will know who she is by listening. Listen to the sounds of the chatter or lack of chatter before and after anyone leaves a room or area. If you notice quiet and the observe a person leaving and suddenly chatter happens it could be her or that could be happenstance. If you notice that the chatter stops when that person gets hear or it seems like everyone might be holding their breathe around this person, or afraid to be to loud depending on this persons mood or presence then you\u2019ve found your Queen bee. \n\nYou can master the queen bee by holding your ground in your clear and concise communication. Do not tailor your approach much to her specifics (unless she is right and you are wrong-then tell her that you appreciate her expertise). But if she\u2019s wrong on something and wants you to do it her way and it\u2019s wrong. DON\u2019T DO IT-THIS IS A TEST or if there is more than one way to skin a cat and you skin it this way and she skins it that way and both have the same correct outcome, HOLD YOUR GROUND ABOUT YOUR APPROACH IF SHE CONFRONTS YOU ABOUT IT-be polite yet firm and do not back down. know that everyone will be watching and/listening how your interaction occurs and will know who the \u201cwinner\u201d is for this power struggle. \n\nIf you win it, then you\u2019ll be the new queen bee (whether male or female) and will be able to use your powers for good and not evil (meaning you can be chill and cool and influence your office with your own unique positive attitude etc.) never use this power for negative or backtalk or gossip.

Maybe it''s because they were forced into this interview and they'd rather be somewhere else (maybe finishing up their work). Maybe they already think they filled the position, but they need to go through the motions of interviewing everyone HR sent as a candidate. Either way, you drew the short straw. Just bad timing. They will either let you pass to the actual decision maker with some notes, or tell you someone will be in touch with next steps.

When what you do is just facilitating a large Corporation's ability to exploit the tax system or meet some reporting obligation that creates trust in the financial system, and where that same corporation is likely underpaying its people and doling out huge bonuses to its executives, it's hard to make your purpose compelling to want to sit there pulling 15 hours days and weekends. Firms try to brand our professionals as \"trusted business advisors\" which we are, but it's to who benefits from our expertise that is the problem. The audit relationship is adversarial, and the tax relationship is an obligation. Boy, am I inspired.\n\nAll jobs have their challenges, but there is something about accounting where you don't get the job satisfaction and real-world impact that you may get in other careers. In tax for example, your impact is indirect. You're a \"vendor\" for most clients. You provide a service that either meets a compliance obligation or you provide tax saving services for a mindless corporation where most of the benefit of your effort is not only expected but at the same time never enough. You prepare and file returns early one year and clients want it earlier the next or eat up the time you put in to deliver early by taking more than needed time to review. You doing an exceptional job is the bare minimum. Client's will replace their vendors as soon as they can when it becomes cost effective to do so. There are dozens of other firms trying to cut each other down to try and take more pieces of the same pie. \n\nOn the other hand, nurses for example make a direct impact on an actual person. The job is difficult no doubt, but you can see the real-world impact of your effort in real-time.

Oddly enough, everything has come full circle and I know have the exact position that my principles I &amp; II teacher had as a business administration instructor at the exact same institution 14 years ago. I stumbled upon this Reddit post, as even though accounting is my specialty, I feel like my students just aren\u2019t getting it.\n\nThen I remembered that for as awesome as my principles I and II teacher was, even he had a somewhat high drop rate. Accounting is just one of those things people either get or they don\u2019t, and often traditional age students don\u2019t have the maturity level for it (I was a non-trad student by the time I took college seriously). And even for those of us that get it, and may even love it for a while, we may get burned out on it from time to time.\n\nBy that point (while getting associates in business) I knew I wanted to be an accountant (and I was subsequently for several years after my bachelors degree), but often younger students don\u2019t really know exactly what it is that they want to do, much less how to go about it or what all it really entails. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t do engineering instead, but again it\u2019s a matter of maturity. I would not have had the maturity level for it at the time, even as an older student. I could do it now, but I\u2019m entering into that \u201ckind of old\u201d stage in life. \n\nAnd then when I really think about it, and I\u2019ve had this thought before, I can\u2019t think of a single kid I ever knew that said \u201cI want to be an accountant\u201d while in grade school. I\u2019m sure some oddball kid is out there somewhere that wants to be an accountant, but I\u2019ve never really known it to be some career that young kids aspire to. \n\nI\u2019ve also found it to be a field that has a lot of stereotypes attached to it. Like we\u2019re all dorks wearing glasses crunching numbers somewhere who are kind of dull and introverted at times. And don\u2019t get me wrong, the stereotype is not wrong, not completely. And I think that turns young people off to accounting as a career choice. But underneath that stereotyped person is someone more nuanced and dynamic, in both good and bad ways. Some of us are mentally ill. Some of us are alcoholics. Some delve into stuff far more illicit than alcohol. Some of us are music buffs, or history buffs, or we have strange interests, or we might even be creative types, believe it or not. Having been an accountant and an auditor, I\u2019ve seen almost all of it, whether it was within me or others in the field.\n\nWe\u2019re human, just like anyone in any other career, and I think some fail to see that. Some of it is of our own doing. Some of it is not. \n\nThanks for posting this topic. I\u2019m trying to be the best principles I &amp; II teacher just like the one I had 14 years ago, and as I ponder this topic it\u2019s apparent that I need to change my approach on a few things. \n\nThis ended up being a somewhat long ass response after all.", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "AnxietyFunTime", "replies": [{"selftext": "Yeah, a lot of us have OCD and/or ADHD.

Yes I worked hard and I put in plenty of hours, but you can't expect things to be handed to you. \n\nPeople come here to bitch and complain. And exaggerate...a lot. \n\nEveryone thinks they're worth more than they are. Newsflash - you know basically nothing after a couple of years in PA and basically only slightly more than nothing with three to four years of experience. Everyone thinks they were so smart to job hop every year or two for a 20% bump but at some point that catches up with people. Either when firms are doing layoffs or when employers realize that your 6, 8 or 10 years of experience isn't real because you've moved around so much and basically only half of the time is worth anything. \n\nAs far as WLB and hours go, 1) refer to my prior comment about people exaggerating and 2) it depends. Two people can graduate from the same university and start with the same company on the same day and have two wildly different experiences. It's going to depend on the teams you work with and clients you're on, and to some extent yourself. Some like to spout off that they refuse to work any OT, won't work/respond to emails after 5pm, etc. That's unreasonable but likewise no one should be working 70 or 80 hours each and every week (and chances are that someone who says they are is full of shit).\n\nMy advice is to find what you like to do instead of chasing money...not saying that you shouldn't be paid fairly but you don't switch jobs because someone is paying a few dollars more when you can be throwing away a career and future where you're at. Not everyone is cut out for FDD, consulting, advisory, \\[insert service line here\\]. There's nothing wrong with being in audit or tax, especially if that's what you're good at and will excel at. Good audit partners/directors at B4 make a lot of money. If you get to the point in your career where you feel that you aren't learning anymore, then you either look to move onto new engagements or you look to do something else in the firm.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "HopefulCat3558", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Math.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "Palnecro1", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "I'd be a plumber", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "prince0verit", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Computer information systems.

The stall in the bathroom doesn\u2019t close all the way, paint is peeling and grass is overgrown, and the AC on my side of the building doesn\u2019t work. They\u2019re also cheap. They won\u2019t pay for adobe, they don\u2019t pay for checkpoint, or CPE etc. they said something about waiting for insurance proceeds to fix the ceiling, which is concerning from a cash flow standpoint. \n\n2: the auditing isn\u2019t done well. I\u2019ve opened binders and seen tons of mistakes in prior years, see materiality all over the place in terms of scope, and ASU 2016-02 is not being implemented properly. I\u2019m fearful for peer review. I see plenty of audits where an associate does the work; and then another associate reviews it and it\u2019s apparent neither knows what they\u2019re doing. Sometimes the partner doesn\u2019t even review portions of the binder. The audits just take however long they take, and there\u2019s no schedule, no urgency etc \n\n3: I\u2019ve seen old forms and lists of the firm, they used to have 30 employees, now they have 14, growth is not happening. I was led to believe audit was growing at least. And, a growth mindset isn\u2019t there, they do nothing to promote themselves, no conferences, recruiting, articles written, teachings etc. \n\n4: I don\u2019t see much growth for myself there.

Just about anybody who has any inkling of anything has heard of the term \u201cCPA\u201d before - \u201cyeah i have a CPA do my taxes\u201d \u201chire a CPA\u201d etc\u2026\n\nWhy go through the effort of getting a CMA when a little bit more effort and you will have an extremely valuable certification. \n\nDo you see how there is a shortage of us CPA\u2019s?

I had no help and no opportunity for advancement, and didn\u2019t learn anything new after the first couple years, but I lived in the middle of nowhere, lcol, my commute was 15 minutes, and the money was decent.\n\nWhen my peer left and I took on all her work for a small increase, it quickly broke me. I left and got a job (12% pay cut) with a large private company, hour and twenty commute each way. Sounds miserable? Nope. Since then it\u2019s been amazing. I\u2019ve been promoted twice, doubled my salary in 7 years (more than doubled after bonus) and am well respected by my peers. After the first promotion we moved closer and eventually bought a house. I no longer live in the middle of nowhere! This company is the leader in its industry, not going anywhere - plenty of opportunities for continued advancement and a great hybrid work environment. Have I missed a better opportunity (or series of them) by not switching employers again? Statistics say it\u2019s likely, but I freakin\u2019 love it here. Forgot to mention, we aren\u2019t SEC but we are a PBE. \n\nPoint of the story: do not get moldy. Do not get comfortable with mediocrity. Do not work for a small employer if you want to learn a lot and have a good salary. If you have a big title in a small company, take your lumps and move out, even if you need to take a small haircut. Big companies can be toxic, and I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t have some luck along the way, but the right one will give you a real platform for success and stability. Want to know the best part? I rarely work more than 40 hours a week, and in my current role, I\u2019m out of monthly close. I get busy at the end of a quarter, but don\u2019t remember ever putting in more than 50 in a week. Good luck to you all! \n\nPS. Don\u2019t be afraid of technical accounting.

Preventable care is usually free with these plans, so deductible doesn\u2019t apply. If something catastrophic happens, you won\u2019t pay more than a few thousand on these mid-tier plans by meeting deductible and then out-of-pocket maximum. \n\nAnd for most people, they don\u2019t even bother with the marketplace because most folks are insured through their employer. To stay competitive, good employers often offer Cadillac plans. My company offers a plan where the premium is about $200/month, my deductible is $300, and everything is covered at 90%. My out-of-pocket maximum (which I meet every year due to a chronic illness) is $3,500.

So\u2026about $30,000 (conservative) - $5,900 = $24,100 more is paid to a universal system where I 1) have to wait 20 years for a primary care physician (yes, that\u2019s the actual wait time I was quoted in Vancouver, BC\u2026it\u2019s even worse in rural areas), 2) have no continuity of care because I\u2019m treated by a different doc every time I visit a walk-in clinic, 3) don\u2019t have access to a specialist to manage my disease because\u2026see point 1, 4) have less access to medication (preferred meds are established by the province and is usually only 1 option, compared to several with private insurers) and 5) god forbid an emergency happens, I might die in the ER because it\u2019s clogged with people taking advantage of the \u201cfree\u201d system, coming in with a nosebleed. \n\nI\u2019ve lived in both Canada (single-payer system), and the US.

And furthermore, what\u2019s the point of even having the system when it only \u201cworks\u201d for folks who don\u2019t need it?\n\nThe US has a hybrid model of care that I think excels in many ways.

{"post": {"title": "Roomate threatining legal action if I dont refund her half of the money she paid me for backing out on moving in. Who's in the wrong? Who would win in court? (Please read)", "subreddit": "AskALawyer", "selftext": "So I've been looking to rent out one of my 2 apartment bedrooms. I've been talking to this woman via roomies on and off for a couple of months now. She said she had to go away for work. But she said she'll be back mid-October. Well, just this past saturday, I got a text at 7:30 a.m., with her saying she's back home 3 weeks early and was ready to move in. \n\nI charge $900 monthly, but since it's late in the month, she asked if she could only pay $400 for the remainder of Sept, and I was fine with that. No problem.\n\nSo I scramble, doing emergency cleaning and whatnot. She's coming from New York, and she's never seen my place besides the pictures I provided. She arrives 3 hrs later at around 11am and comes in, I show her around the place and the room. She seems cool with it and puts the $400 cash in my hand. No contract or roomate agreement was made or signed since it all happened so quickly that I didn't get a chance to print out a free roommate agreement provided by the roomies website. After paying me, she then said she was going to go out and get a bed and dresser for the room and come back to finish moving in, perfect. So I continued cleaning up the room and around the place. and around 2 p.m., I called her to touch base. All still seems good. She was getting her things she said from her ex husbands house. I told her I got keys made, and Im on the way to get groceries and asked if she wanted anything. She said no, I say ok see you later. So I grab groceries, which I didn't plan on getting, but I stocked up on food for me and her, and got gas for my car. I used $200 of the $400 cash she gave me, that I thought was rightfully mine to spend as I please. As the room was hers to do as she pleases.\n\nOk, here's where the problem begins...\n\nSo around 4:15 pm, she called me, saying her kids were begging her to stay at her ex husbands house and her ex was away on vaca, blah blah, so she says... She says she's gonna stay in a room in her ex husbands house that was offered to her for a couple weeks, then move in next month. I feel incredibly screwed over and inconvenienced. She asks if I can refund her the money or if I want to keep it and take it off of her rent next month when she moves in. I tell her I spent half of it already, but I can give her $200. She accepts that, and I venmo her $200 immediately after hanging up. This was Saturday..\n\nI knew she was lying and wasn't really coming back. But I honestly spent half of the money she gave me, not thinking she would bail on the agreement hours later. Again, we even spoke mid day, and she still gave me the misleading impression that she was moving in before I went grocery shopping. \n\nSo now it's Tuesday, and she texts me in the AM confirming what I already suspected. That she wasn't moving back, she's staying \"wheres shes at\" until December. She asks, \" In the next week or 2, can I pay her back the other $200\" from the $400 she gave me.\n\nI texted back, basically saying I honestly spent the other $200 that she paid me. $200 I wouldn't have spent had she not showed up to my place for such a sudden move in. I told her that \"giving her an additional $200 would come directly out of my pocket, and I dont have it to give.\" And Im not taking a hit because she decided to screw me over and bail on our agreement.\n\nNow this bih is accusing me of stealing her money. She threatened to take legal action if I dont pay her in 2 weeks. I argued my position in the fact that she screwed me over by bailing on our agreement AFTER she paid me cash money and AFTER I spent half of it under the misled impression that she was coming back to move in with her stuff. I told her to get you a lawyer, and I'll get mine. She also threatened to hit me with attorney fees.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I wrong, or is she wrong? Who would win in court if we we're to go there?\n\n***Edit: The room was NOT on hold. She did say that she understands if I  pursue other options.  But I still held out for her on my own volition, just to be clear. The money she gave was not a deposit. It was rent for the remainder of the month. There was no deposit. I said just pay me rent first thing when moving in and go month to month. I wanted to make moving in an easy process for both of us. Im not here to burden or gouge anyone for money. I just wanted to rent my room out so I can have extra money to do what I want with it.", "ups": 139, "permalink": "/r/AskALawyer/comments/16syiyb/roomate_threatining_legal_action_if_i_dont_refund/", "num_comments": 89}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Lol.

Is there anything her or I can do to get him. We're both willing to testify, submit to polygraph, whatever you need. I need help because he's got two girls from what I hear, and he still hangs around my older brothers house with their kids. Please I'm begging at this point.... please help me.\n\nThis happened to me when I would've been about 10 - 15 year old range, I can't pin down dates because it causes me a great deal of pain reliving it, but to get as much help as possible, I'm willing to endure whatever. I'm 39 now, the statute of limitations is probably over for me. But my sister I recently found out was a victim under the same roof, to the same cousin that raped me. Now I want to talk to my sister, but I don't want to either until something has started up. I don't want to hear the story but eventually I will have to, and the same for her. I love and care for my sister and her daughter, not even sure of her name (if that says anything about how our \"family\" situation is) that's just how I am. I know my brother and his wife have kids, but I don't know their names, or really even how many kids they have now. My brother is inadvertently responsible for this whole \"situation\". My brother back when we were in school, loved to hunt, loved hunting with the cousin that raped my sister and I. I doubt he knew but what was happening to me made me grow very distrusting towards him, as I say I don't think he knew but in my head at the time he did. So in my head I've hated my brother for decades for never protecting me or my sister from our cousin. The cousin and my older brother were best friends, so anytime I would complain about the cousin to my brother or really any \"family\" in general, I was called a retard, and a faggot, and any and all names under the sun, not to mention all the beatings I went thru. No one really ever wondered about anything after I was pretty much looked at like a family joke. So I broke ties with ALL my family. My mother was the first one that wondered what was going on when I came to her after shitty blood, I don't mean to get graphic but, it was a lot of blood and other things, this was after one of the worst rappings he ever did, he tore my anus open, left permeant scars and a lifetime of pain.\n\n\nTo be continued..........

The procedure may differ a bit from state to state, but it works pretty much the same everywhere. \n\nThis happened because you did not notify the court that you are now 'pro se'.  This is the same as an attorney filing an entry of their appearance.  Based on that the court sends out the notifications. Of course there's a chance that your old lawyer did not enter a withdrawal of appearance, which I doubt very much. This is an important administrative step that alerts the court where to send new notices. And when an attorney has his appearance stricken the clerk's office sends out a notice to said attorney's client to either obtain new counsel within a certain time period or to enter your appearance pro se.  Your old lawyer would have gotten that notice also. The parties are required to be present at hearings, whether it is a counsel you retain or you personally. Since no one appeared on your behalf, you got slapped with the non-appearance.  You must now act as your own attorney and submit your requests and motions to the court as required by the court's rules.  It is up to the judge how they will rule regarding your failure to appear.\n\nYou might want to contact the clerk's office and ask why you weren't notified.  They will probably explain to you that you were notified through your old counsel, since the court is not aware of your pro se status.  Ask if you can come in and file a pro se notice, which BTW also requires a certificate of service. This certificate evidences to the court that you have sent copies of your notice to all parties of record.

{"post": {"title": "How can I go about getting a restraining order/pressing charges for cyber harassment?", "subreddit": "AskALawyer", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nFor a bit of background, I\u2019m 18 years old and I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. However, the people I\u2019m dealing with are from Texas, Alabama, and Ohio.\n\nYears ago, in 2016, I made an instagram account to join a niche community, and within my first few months I had made a group of friends. Throughout our friendship we talked a lot, FaceTimed, called, etc. so I know they are real people and not catfishes/scammers. To summarize since it has nothing to do with what I\u2019m necessarily seeking advice on, towards the end of our friendship there was lots of drama involved, and I decided I just didn\u2019t want to deal with them anymore so I cut the entire group off. There admittedly was bad blood since we didn\u2019t end on the best of terms, but I stopped talking to them in late 2022, about a year ago.\n\nFor months after I had cut them off they would text me often, saying things to get my attention and adding me to group chats, to which I ignored. The \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d if you will, was when they added me back into their group chat, and sent an edited screenshot of me supposedly saying some really nasty, sexual, things and accusing me of being a pedophile (which made no sense because it was apparently two years old, which meant I would have been 16, and the girl I was supposedly \u201ctalking to\u201d was 15). This is where I called them out, I called the person who sent the screenshot and accused me, talked to him on the phone for a good 15 minutes, got him to admit the screenshot was edited on the phone AND through text, which I have proof of him saying.\n\nWe talked a bit over the following days, but it was the same old, and I wanted no part in any of it, so I just stopped talking to them. They proceeded to blow up my phone with countless texts and calls. I couldn\u2019t go on my phone without getting a call every other minute and a text message full of cursing me out and insulting me. It got to the point where they began doctoring screenshots of me saying even more nasty things about me, calling me a rapist, a pedophile, and more. I had to change my phone number, delete every social media I had them on, and I thought that would be the end of it. But it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThey found even more ways to try and reach me. They made a fake Facebook account posing as a musician I listen to, and tried messaging me, which led to me having to get rid of Facebook. They then began contracting my dad, commenting on his posts, telling him that they miss me and to tell me to contact them. Most recently, I found that they made a fake Instagram account of my deceased uncle who just recently passed this past May, posting photos of him calling him a racist and a white supremacist and commenting a bunch of nasty things on my dad\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nI\u2019m not the only person they\u2019ve done this to, either. They did this to another friend of mine, they threatened him, they blackmailed him, made fake accounts of him calling him a \u201cthreat\u201d and a school shooter, commented on people he know\u2019s accounts and his community college\u2019s account, and ultimately led to him having to get off social media entirely to avoid them.\n\nI\u2019m wanting to know if there is any sort of action I can take. I feel like for the better part of the past year, I\u2019ve been dealing with harassment from the same group of people, and I\u2019m over it.

Similarly situated people treated differently on the basis of a protected characteristic. Like an equally qualified woman being systematically passed over for promotion in favor of men. Damages for the mistreatment could be calculated using the pay difference.

Which is a huge problem. Not only did you not meet their deadline, the fact that you had to establish a relationship (8 visits) before the doc would write you a note suggests you were not actively treating your bipolar at the time you claimed you needed an accommodation for it. In other words, your disability didn\u2019t become a disability until you wanted special accommodation. If you were actively treating your bipolar disorder you could have gotten a note within 72 hours.\n\n5) You can be your own lawyer if you want.

OP requested a schedule change back in April for an alleged disability that would require a reasonable accommodation. The employer asked for documentation showing a disability that required an accommodation. Discharge papers from a mental health facility is NOT proof.

After OP turned in BS documents, the employer advised that OP needed to have a medical professional complete the proper ADA paperwork. OP was given 2 weeks to do so.

This varies by state. Also, what assets do you have? If you are low income, I\u2019m assuming you may not have much. Are you renting or buying your home? What exactly are you worried about him getting? If you have few assets, a divorce will be fairly straightforward, and you can propose which assets you feel you are entitled to and provide supporting documentation. \n\nI also wanted to ask if you had a court date since the temporary order was put in place? Generally when there is a temporary restraining order, there is a court date set where the courts will determine whether a longer restraining/no contact order is warranted. Be prepared for this. Write down anything you can that you remember about his abusive behaviors and make a case for them to extend the temporary one to a more permanent one - a year would be ideal. Try to emphasize that he also was physically/emotionally abusive towards your children as well, so that he also will be forbidden from seeing them. \n\nIf your soon to be ex husband tries to contact you when there is a no contact order in place, DO NOT RESPOND. it may be tempting, but a no contact order goes both ways, regardless of who initiates it. So if he reaches out, ignore him, no matter how awful he gets. And report any and every violation he makes, because he likely will. \n\nI am a survivor of domestic abuse, I also am a survivor of childhood abuse. I have two children from a two previous abusive relationships, and after I finally did the work in myself to figure out why I accepted the behaviors I did, I found a wonderful partner. We are married now and have a child together, yep I have three baby daddies, and we are all just fine. My older two children are thriving, despite the abuse they witnessed, and of course my youngest is being raised in the most stable and loving environment. My husband has is a nurse.

He Zelle'd me $1500, but because I didn't have an account he was able to reverse the transaction before I signed up. (I was not aware you could do this until it was too late). He already has the signed title and vehicle in his possession. Once I noticed the funds hadn't cleared, I asked Zelle's support who told me it may take several days for the transaction to appear, but it never did. I called and texted the individual to see if it was a mistake, he never responded. The only thing I got was the laptop, and he actually almost drove off with it, but I reminded him before he left which was lucky.\n\nAnd before people say what we're all thinking, yes I made a bad judgment call. I shouldn't have let him have the title before the money cleared... This was my first time selling a car. I didn't think he would fleece me for $1500, and he seemed like a decent dude at the time.\n\nSo far I've filed a police report, and they told me that due to the structure of the bill of sale it would need to be handled by a civil court.  The detective on the case also said I could petition for a repossession order or writ of sequestration.\n\nMy question, Is it worth pursuing him in a civil court and filing for a writ of sequestration? Additionally, what\u2019s the best course of action to increase my odds of winning said case?\n\nThe cost of filing a claim is $85 plus whatever the cost of serving him would be.\n\nI have the following evidence:\n\n1. Texts messages between me and him.\n2. Bill of sale, dated and signed by both parties.\n3. Text from Zelle showing he sent $1500 to my number on the same date as the sale.(I wasn't signed up yet so it asked me to enroll.)\n4. Police report\n5. A recent copy of his drivers license.\n\nI'm thinking that given the Zelle text, he would need to prove to the judge that he did pay me, which because he didn't would mean I have a pretty good chance of winning. I have never been to court before so I\u2019m lost on what I need to do.\n\nHonestly, I just want to make his life a pain in the ass for scamming me.

A few years ago, NV changed the rules and now only the owner can register the car which means that if the state has your name on the title, the last registration is yours. They will remove the registration if you turn in the plates but to re-register it means you need to have the title. Also, the plates go with the owner, not the car. If I buy a car in CA, I can drive it (assuming valid tags) to NV. If you buy a car in NV, you'll need to go to the DMV first for a temporary movement permit (and show insurance) before you drive it back to CA. \n\nThe seller of a car in NV does nothing but sign the title, releasing ownership. The NV DMV does have a bill of sale, but its primarily for record keeping and isn't part of the sale at all. The title is everything.

If not, and you still legally hold the title, I suspect that severing that record of ownership could solve a lot of your problems. If you no longer have a copy of the title, you should be able to get a duplicate from the state, at which point you could do whatever you need with it. Fortunately I've only had one experience with a sketchy buyer, and when he drug his feet on transferring the title I gave him a deadline and said that if the car wasn't out of my name by then, I'd be junking the title.

The police showed up and talked to the guy. He and the police knew each other, it seemed very well.

He worked behind the scenes and got a deal of it being dropped. We paid 3800 for fines and fees, it was a typical behind-the-scenes small-town transaction.  We moved to Florida a few months later, and everything went away. Or so we thought...\n\nShe went to renew her license in Florida, and they said it was flagged out of Louisiana as suspended. We checked, and Lousiana has a hold on her for hit and run, leaving the scene, and registration.\n\nTurns out our attorney was a drug addict and was taking everyone's money and not filing or following through on several of his clients. He was stealing, robbing everyone blind to support his addiction to painkillers. I had no idea as we had moved and he wasn't a talk all the time friend. He was even disbarred and charges against him. I have no records anymore of anything, and his practice is long shut down. Our ex-lawyer has demonstrated that he did this to at least 10 other clients in some way or fashion. \n\nWe have called the small-town courts and explained everything. The clerk they have basically said tough luck. She needs to come in and pay 385 dollars in court fees and set a court date. Then she will need to appear in court for the charges. \n\nI have this fear that we go and pay the fine and they say \"Well you live in Florida so we are holding you until court in 2 months.\" They have no way of zoom court or even to pay the fees not in person..\n\nWhat do we do?

And since Ukraine was busy defending itself from a full scale invasion, they didn\u2019t have time to be the major supplier of wheat they usually are, which crippled global wheat supplies increasing the cost of food. \n\nFor NK missiles? Obama was president in 2016. Trump wasn\u2019t sworn in until Jan 2017. \n\nAfghan exit plan was bad. I agree. Not sure how that relates to the economy though. \n\nTrump did want to bring back manufacturing jobs. His plan was just slap China and our Allie\u2019s with tariffs. Economically speaking that\u2019s like trying to drill a screw in using dynamite. Biden wants us manufacturing to grow too. Biden also banned certain tech investments in China and us citizens from working for Chinese companies in sensitive sectors. More importantly with the decoupling of China, late last year multiple major US companies (apple being the most significant) have announced plans to divest manufacturing operations out of China. \n\nLiterally haven\u2019t heard about masks coming back except from Fox News saying some fringe people are recommending it. I assume you haven\u2019t heard much about covid after 2021 since people had natural immunity or were vaccinated though. Using Occam\u2019s razor that seems to be a simpler solution opposed to a vast conspiracy to make trump look bad. \n\nPeople do want to work. Hence labor force participation rate increasing. And if you think the average real life person is defined by a related subreddits most upvoted posts then you need to take a break from the internet and talk to real people. Obviously everyone is going to want to get paid more for what they do, but they aren\u2019t staying unemployed because of it. I was also literally just out running errands. Stopped at multiple stores. Saw zero hiring signs. The data proves that as well. Year over year total job openings have fallen ~2.5million. \n\nYou say the economy is down, and then proceed to give a word vomit full of non-economic points. I\u2019m not sure you know how to actually determine the health of an economy based off what you said. But that doesn\u2019t surprise me though. People typically listen to something that will agree with them no matter what proof is shown to prove otherwise. \n\n\nHere\u2019s the source for all the stats I provided earlier.

Listen to him long enough and he\u2019ll confess. That\u2019s how this whole thread got started. \n\nThe military operation lasted 1 month 6 days. Then they held a forced illegal referendum on annexation behind closed doors with Russian military inside and out. The annexed area still hasn\u2019t been returned. Maybe try reading more than the first line of the \u201cannexation of Crimea by the Russian federation\u201d Wikipedia article that you got that very specific time period from. They detail they go into make it look a lot worse than I just did. \n\nEnergy is a global market. Even countries that never bought from Russia have gas prices spike. Even green energy is affected. Google intro to supply and demand. That should give you a good explanation of what\u2019s going on. So even though we are pumping 700m more barrels/year domestically than when trump left office, it\u2019s not enough cause US oil companies trade on the global market. And with OPEC supply cuts (which is solely designed to increase prices), it\u2019s just a recipe for disaster. \n\nHere\u2019s a list of NK missile tests, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_Korean_missile_tests. Notice they happened every year? Including during trumps term. \n\nI do remember covid was a big deal in 2020. That\u2019s when it first became a global pandemic. Weird how when new and catastrophic things happen they tend to be a big thing when they first happen. And yes. Trump did a good job with the vaccines and removing regulatory red tape. Then once vaccine intake reached critical mass (q3 or q4 of 2021) it stopped being an issue, cause it was effective enough at reducing the burden on the morgues and hospitals.\n\nI didn\u2019t miss any signs. You must have missed the data I sent you showing job openings have decreased while labor force participation increased. That means more people who previously didn\u2019t have jobs that weren\u2019t previously looking for one (students, stay at home moms, temp disability, etc) found jobs. And now there are less open roles. here\u2019s McDonald\u2019s financial statements (page 36 is the income statement). Payroll from in store employees is 11% of their revenue. They paid store employees 2.6b and profited 6.1b. If they gave everyone a 50% raise they\u2019d still have a profit of $4.8 Billion. Not saying they should do that, but their margins are big enough to increase pay, keep prices flat, and still Profit almost 5 Billion dollars. They pay about as much in rent/building ownership as they do in payroll (both excluding corporate expenses). \n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000063908/000006390823000012/mcd-20221231.htm\n\nOnce again.

{"post": {"title": "Should I change my divorce attorney?", "subreddit": "AskALawyer", "selftext": "When I decided to file for divorce I was hopeful for an amicable divorce but was aware of my ex having hid money and spent money on his paramour, gambling and drugs although I had no idea how much. I was hopeful that because he was eager to fully be in his new relationship that we could settle via a mediator. Other friends that had been through recent divorces in Texas told me that the court will make the parties mediate financial settlement no matter how many times it takes. My job is to manage contract negotiations and unwind and renegotiate contracts. I took the view that this would be a similar type of project    but in a family court. My goal in hiring a trial attorney experienced with divorce was to ensure I had the most accurate financial view possible in preparation for these mediations and good advice on how to appeal to the courts using family law. I filed mid-March and immediately submitted the financial documents of ours that I have access to. \n\nAdditionally, my ex had been traveling for 1/4 of the previous year with his GF because she lives in another city and much of the relationship seems to require lavish vacations. He would often give me only a few days notice that he would be leaving town with no set return date. If he did provide a return date, he would often extended the trip beyond his stated return and let me know the day of. After I filed he let me know he had no intention of following an interim custody schedule and would travel as he pleases. I work and rearranging my schedule last minute to take our kids to and from school and forego my own work travel was, to say the least taxing. So had my attorney request an emergency custody hearing. In the initial filing I requested primary custody in order to better plan my time around caring for the kids. Because he refused to stick to the schedule I had my attorney request an emergency custody hearing early June. \n\nWe had a mediation in early August. Because my ex hadn\u2019t turned over all of his statements my attorney told me we would only be negotiating custody. We spent 8 hours negotiating and renegotiating each item with no agreement. When I asked for triggers in the language (ie\u2026 if he doesn\u2019t show up x times then x will happen) the mediator would point to how i could not do that and would need to go back to court if such things were to happen. We had no resolution there. I told my attorney afterwards that I would like to go to trial on custody matters and risk a judge assigning the worst case scenario than sit through another expensive and pointless mediation on custody (understanding that financial settlement would require mediation no matter what).\n\nIn that time I still have not seen a financial settlement proposal, no new discovery has been presented to me, and I\u2019ve spoken to my attorney via phone  a grand total of 6 times since I filed. When he violates orders on spending I simply pull the evidence and email it to my attorney for record and review (only twice). No injunctions or violations sent to him that I am aware of, so maybe they aren\u2019t actual violations? \n\nI have been billed weekly for new charges, many weeks that I have no email or phone contact with the attorney. The fees are now at about $35k. I emailed twice asking for an update on what has been done and what the strategy is going into the next mediation for early October. The first response was essentially \u201cwe\u2019re working on it and will come back to you when we have everything.\u201d  No response to my last email. My attorney is a junior at the firm and charges a rate of $350/hour. I am ok with junior people as they are often hungry to prove themselves and can leverage senior guidance at a lower rate. What is clear is that I\u2019m being charged the $750/hour rate plus my attorneys rate for every conversation she has with senior partners about my case. \n\nAs of now, my understanding on next steps are that we will mediate on both fronts with whatever my attorney has prepared and if it doesn\u2019t go well then we will just have to return to mediation until an agreement can be reached. I feel like I have spent a lot of money so far to handle this divorce in a way that doesn\u2019t seem to leverage trial experience. Should I change attorneys? What can I do about all these fees I\u2019ve already paid? I am a big believer in trusting the people I pay to do their work without constant updates but i feel like I have no plan, nothing to show for my part and am reluctant to change course and spend more money starting with a new firm. \n\nPlease advise.", "ups": 8, "permalink": "/r/AskALawyer/comments/16lveok/should_i_change_my_divorce_attorney/", "num_comments": 11}, "replies": [{"selftext": "if it was me, i probably would and tell them that \"due to lack uf updates where i can be informed on what i think is best for me, i will no longer be using your firm nor will i be paying for a service you have failed to provide\" this will get them to reply to you mostly angrily in how you cant do that, you owe them money, etc. but you are the one who has hired them, they work for you and just like any boss would you at least wanted updates to know how your case was going and if they want their money, they can add it to your EXs bill since he is refusing time and again to show up to these.", "ups": 4, "depth": 0, "author": "Away_Tonight7204", "replies": [{"selftext": "I\u2019ve already paid them.

A Trust owns the property. The property owner died in 2019. In CA we have proposition 13 which limits the amount property tax can go up per year. I believe it is 1% a year. The property owner built the shopping center 60 years ago and I believe it was last appraised in 1978 with the passage of Prop 13. and now it has been reappraised after their death.

During these past four years I was paying property tax at the lower amount as I always have because it had not been reappraised yet.\n\nI was informed on a letter dated May 22, 2023 of the landlord's death in 2019 and that the property taxes would be increasing substantially and they would get back to me on the amount owed. I then received a letter dated August 8th with a breakdown of the new amounts to be owed for the total of the 4 years at the new amount that was due in 30 days. The amount they want subtracts out the previous prop tax I paid but it is still a lot. Due to the increases in rent from inflation and the new property tax it was really more than I could afford in this space. I am on a month to month lease and my thought was that if I gave 30 days notice and vacated the space I would not be liable for the accumulated property taxes, or at worse only property taxes from May 22, 2023 when I received notice of the death and reappraisal.

Look for any language that specifies how changes in property taxes are handled and whether these can be back-dated.\n\n2. **Good Faith and Fair Dealing**: In contracts, especially in California, there's an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Failure to inform you of impending substantial increases in property taxes may be a violation of this covenant.\n\n3. **Proposition 13**: Although Prop 13 generally limits tax increases to 1% per annum, reassessments can occur when ownership changes, as in the case of the death of the property owner. However, the timing and communication around this reassessment are critical and potentially disputable.\n\n4. **Statute of Limitations**: In commercial real estate, there may be a limitation period for back-dating charges or claims. You'll need to confirm this aspect, given that you've been billed retroactively for four years.\n\n5. **Month-to-Month Lease**: Being on a month-to-month lease potentially offers you an opportunity to terminate the agreement, thereby limiting your liability to the period you've actively used the property post-notification.\n\n6. **Legal Counsel**: Given the complexities involved and the substantial amount of money at stake, engaging a real estate attorney with expertise in California tax law is strongly advised. They can review your lease agreement, provide tailored advice, and potentially negotiate with the Trust that owns the property.\n\n7. **Audit the Tax Assessment**: You can request a detailed breakdown of the tax reappraisal to confirm its accuracy, especially if you suspect any inconsistencies or unfair practices.", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "Followyourtroves", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Are you in Riverside?

It's my first round of midterms in law school so I am terrified already. I went to take my nighttime meds...you may see where this is going...and I took my VYVANSE at midnight on a Sunday before a stupid important week because I'm DUMB and went on autopilot taking my meds. Not just vyvanse mind you, 40 damn mgs of it. I can feel my heart rate increasing already and that feeling of needing to do everything ever all at once is beginning to kick in.\n\nI'm doing my best to stay in my bed and ride it out until I hopefully fall asleep at some point but my messy apartment calls to me. Right now, just a whisper. \"Clean me\" it says \"the doormat has stuff stuck in it and it bothers you every time you walk by it. Just pick everything out of it right now by hand.\" My laptop and school books are joining in saying \"what about all the studying and the colorcoding you have yet to do? Also weren't you going to put that anti glare sticker on your laptop screen? No time like the present\". My email joins in the chorus, telling me that I'm behind in responding to people and my bathroom pipes up, knowing that the shelves are disorganized and ugly. It's a cacophony of tasks all begging for my attention, which I now have an overabundance to give at the worst time.\n\nI know if I give in I'll end up doing useless odds and ends tasks anyway because sitting on my floor applying that antiglare sticker to my laptop sounds mighty tempting. All the useless tasks...they need someone to fumble around and do them aimlessly, that is my duty in this life. That duty is calling, but I have to let it go to voice-mail, lest I give in and start my week a miserable disaster and one vyvanse short during midterms. FML.\n\nEdit: it is now the morning after.

No junk mail begging you to come back when it ends.\n\nBut a disclaimer, most services will start to catch on of you're overusing and abusing them. They'll just block your IP or find some other method to identify you like browser fingerprinting.

Stop. Celebrate ! \n\n* If you are overwhelmed picking a single task, pick a single task anyway. Do it for five minutes, then pick another task. \n\n* Do not get bogged down trying to work out what is the most important task. Any task is moving. You cannot steer a parked car. \n\n* Pick the same time everyday to do \u201cTasks\u201d. Doesn\u2019t matter when, but have \u201cTask Time\u201d. Set a reminder. \n\nRage : this is understandable, but unhelpful. Quite a lot of it is a somatic response to frustration ie; neurotransmitters going bonkers. \n \nYou may feel that it sucks that you have this, that the world is unfair, that it makes it so much harder for you, that other people are judging you. \n\nAll of these things may be true, but these thoughts are unhelpful, and they make you feel like shit. \n\nYou can\u2019t not think thoughts.

You know if you step onto the highway you\u2019re gonna be in trouble, dodging and weaving and being flattened. \n\nBut you can train yourself to stand on the side of the highway and watch them rocket past you and just not engage with them. \n\n**You don\u2019t have to act on your throughts**\n\n**Your thoughts don\u2019t have to affect your emotions**\n\nI recommend the Smiling Mind app. It will teach you mindfulness.

Looking for similar experiences!", "subreddit": "adhdmeme", "selftext": "Hi guys!  \nI'm 29m and got diagnosed a few months ago.  \nA lot of stuff makes sense to me now, but i'm still confused..\n\nWhen you get tested for ADHD, they really focus on how you were as a child, from 7 years of age, and how you struggled. (in my country at least)  \nThe thing is, I did great in primary school, and I loved school! The only class I was really bad in was math, and I got extra help after school for that in, a few years of school. Same with High School - I got worse grades and could focus less, but I still passed with \"medium\" grades I would say.  \nWhen it all really started to go bad, was when I moved away from home, which is about 8 years ago.  \nI started struggling with both paying bills, going to work/school, and being social.  \nHow can people do all three in a day? To me it was enough to go to work. I would be completely tired when I got home.  \nThe last 8 years have been very difficult to me, as I've been more and more stressed, trying to juggle all three things, but it doesn't really work for me. My room looks like shit, and I get so stressed when I both have to do my house tasks for my roomies, cook dinner, go to work, and just be a human being and shower and stuff. I end up doing nothing of it, and feels like a bad person.  \nI then \"recover\", learn nothing, and do it aaaaaall again. I would feel so much energy that I - again - would plan things after school every day, and slowly get burned out again.. The thing is I'm very very social and love people, but I can't handle it all combined. I plan too much, and then I still have my house tasks, and school and cooking dinner etc... burnout.  \nThe last two years I've started to get burnouts, where I would just not get out of bed for days, because I was so tired. Finally, about a year ago, I had a huge burnout where I wasn't in school for 4 weeks, and felt very tired and depressed after that.  \nFinally I got the diagnosis, and it makes completely sense to me.  \nMy psychiatrist said I probably had very good parents and people around me as a kid, who could take care of me, and this is very true..  \nI was very quiet in school as a kid, but now I'm talking to everybody and am very extrovert haha. (yes, also interrupting people and finishing their sentences)  \nBut what are your experiences? I guess i'm most interested in you guys who got diagnosed as an adult? What happened, what was the \"turning point\" for you guys?  \nI guess I just have to live with this diagnosis, but it somehow still feels weird, as I didn't struggle as a kid...

It's especially strong in people that have ADHD. We're always late, forgetting things, often have trouble getting words out.  Ask me what I was doing five minutes ago, it'll take me five minutes to remember.\n\n\nAll that stuff makes us (or me at least) always feel like a fraud.  Even in my career where I'm well established and have years of experiences that should make me feel like I'm a master at my craft;  I still feel like I'm wrong and don't deserve it, often.  It helps to learn to ignore that voice, but I don't think it ever goes away.\n\n\n&gt;Is it helping\n\nFor me, starting the meds at 30 was one of the best decisions of my life. They don't \"fix\" it, but they do make everything much more manageable.\n\n\nBefore meds I used to self medicate, but I didn't know that's what I was doing.  \n\n\n* Looking for adrenaline by doing reckless things in cars, on motorcycles, anywhere.  That gave me a bit of what my brain needed.\n\n* Any kind of emotion will feed your brain too.  Arguing with people, putting your favorite song on repeat, convincing yourself that you're a piece of garbage for leaving all this shit on the floor.  That'll all get the ADHD brain what it is starved for.\n\n* I also partied hard at times, that definitely flooded my neurotransmitter starved brain with all sorts of good feels.\n\n\nNow that I'm on meds, I can still do fun stuff, and I still have all the same old emotions.  But, I'm less driven to do all this stupid stuff (that feels amazing) to subsidize my ADHD brain's insufficient levels of neurotransmitters.  And I've been able to start to undo some of the damage caused by using self-hatred to get myself moving every day.\n\n\n&gt;\"worth\" the withdrawals?\n\nIn my opinion there are no appreciable \"withdrawals\" from ADHD stimulant medications.  It's regarded as perfectly safe to start and stop them at will. Some people say they feel tired and grumpy when they stop, but to me, that's just going back to how I was.  Going back to that sucks.  \n\n\nAlso, generally withdrawal symptoms infers an addiction.  ADHD stim meds are especially designed to not give you a \"rush\", and are at such low doses, that they are not addictive, when used as directed. With an addiction, people generally feel compelled to increase their doses steadily, whereas most ADHD folks stay at the same doses in the long term.", "ups": 8, "depth": 2, "author": "ItsBaconOclock", "replies": [{"selftext": "Thanks so much for this comment!!

So if I'm really struggling to finish a project I'll ask him to just sit in the room with me and I miraculously get it done in record time. Look up body doubling because it can be really helpful when you get overwhelmed by tasks like....cleaning out your closet or clearing off the \"rewearable chair.\" He'll even throw out challenges sometimes because he is always racing (it's one of his ADHD coping skills) and say, \"I'm going to cut the grass...how much work do you think you can get done while i'm out there?

Dean's list first year, I did a special program in highschool and first year university was basically just a repeat of highschool.\n\nGot to second year university and immediately went from effortless 95s to failing multiple classes. I had zero work ethic, typical ADHD procrastination, skipped classes because I didn't have the executive functioning skills or delayed gratification skills to make myself go. When I did go, I couldn't focus. Then I battled depression for 4 years. Thankfully I received a 1 in a million job offer and used the opportunity to drop out of university. I haven't gone back and don't regret making the choice.\n\nThis year my daughter was born, and during my wife's pregnancy pregnancy I accidentally hyperfocused on ADHD (ironic lol), went \"oh shit that's me\". So I decided to get tested before she was born and voil\u00e0, I have a moderate severity combined presentation. Now I am working on myself with her as my motivation, I want to be the best dad I can be, and part of that involves learning to better manage my symptoms.\n\nI'm now on Vyvanse and seeing 2 therapists (one for mindfulness and emotional stuff, one for practical stuff and CBT, life skills, etc). Life's looking up.\n\nMy diagnosis was missed as a kid because I was intellectually far beyond my peers. Nobody would even think to consider ADHD.

I would sit and stare at the wall unfocused on the task at hand reading and rereading the posters the teachers had on their walls.   \n\nIn secondary, I was marginally more successful in grades 7 &amp; 8 where I had more challenging classes and a group of teachers who were passionate about the age.  In grades 9-12, I again struggled.  I managed to keep grades up in the first half of the year with no problem because of extra-curricular activities.  Middle of 2nd semester, though, all.bets were off.  1 subject each year my grade would tank.  \n\nWhe  I graduated HS, I was unwilling to go to college due to the frustrations I had with HS.  It took me about 5 years before I was ready.  During that time I worked retail basically full time--I was willing to go in whenever needed beyond my schedule.  I received my AA degree 6 years after I started it.  I only attended part time as I was a single mom by then.  I took another couple of years off before working on my BA.  By then I knew my focus and went to school full time while working nearly full time hours as a substitute teacher.  From my BA, I went straight into my Masters program.  During which I began teaching full time.  \n\nAbout 6 or so years into teaching, I was on a struggle bus daily.  I knew I wasn't doing my best because I struggled with identifying what needed to be done.  And then getting everything done.  I was drowning in paperwork and couldn't get my head above water.  I decided to talk to my doctor who said \"you are just depressed\" even though I already  knew it was ADHD and went I  specifically asking about being assessed for it.  (Gaslight anyone?)  He said I had been functioning well up until then so it was just depression.  The medication he gave me was also used for GAD.  And it helped.  So I did that for 15-ish years to help me not feel overwhelmed.  \n\nBut this last school year kicked my ass totally and completely for a variety of reasons. I would sit at my desk and just stare...  I was SOO overwhelmed and couldn't function beyond absolute basic life functions.  I decided to talk with my new doctor about being assessed.  She said, \"I know you have ADHD just through our interactions.\"  But her Healthcare company does not allow doctors to diagnose  adults so she told me how to go about getting an actual diagnosis.  Once I got diagnosed, I started on meds.  \n\nMy life is so much better now.  I still have struggle bus moments, but I know that those will pass.  I can get my classroom organized.  I can keep up with all the extra shit that I have to do, not only as a teacher, but also as a department lead/chairperson.

Very outdated ideas of how women should work and act implemented by the mostly middle-aged and older men that run and manage these companies. The women I know that report to other female project managers and directors end up doing well (ample studies show that women and men tend to manage differently in professional spaces, so it\u2019s not something that necessarily comes from gender-bias) but most of the women I know that get into the field end up moving to adjacent industries like consulting, project management, and specialists. \n\nI\u2019ve worked for 2 large companies in the A/E/C design/build/validation (EPCMV) field-mostly in civil, biopharma, and electrical/environmental areas-and every woman I work with has found it difficult to move upward in the traditional mobility structure and usually end up making lateral moves before middle-management. Those who get hired in middle- or upper-management (I have yet to see one make the jump through a promotion within the same company) are usually very good networkers and communicators, mostly on the client-side, and are usually older than the male counterparts that are hired for the same roles. Additionally, more than half of those woman are childless. \n\nI know we don\u2019t want to think this about such a \u201cmerit-based\u201d, technical, \u201cintellectual\u201d field but the cognitive dissonance towards it for those exact \u201cbelieved\u201d reasons is exactly what smart, talented, and highly analytical women end up learning pretty early on in their careers, and end up making those appropriate moves. \n\nI\u2019ve straight up seen project managers be tasked with getting coffee for meetings that include their own subordinates when they are the only woman in attendance. In my experience, female managers have advised me to \u201cplay ball\u201d and just go along with the \u201cboys club\u201d (actual words used by a director of construction) in order to get ahead. Most states are at-will employment, meaning you can be terminated with no reason given, and being labeled \u201cdifficult\u201d can land you with no project assignments (as the PM\u2019s get to decide who they give work to) and then therefore \u201cunderemployed\u201d, and then you know the drill\u2026\n\nThe industry is built for high worker turnover and its well known (for any engineer/worker, regardless of gender/education) that the only way to progress or to find accommodation is to job hop.

This is an extremely old-fashioned viewpoint of ADHD (and indeed, many other mental health conditions), because neurotypical people just cannot understand it, just like we simply cannot understand how they function in the world. But understand that the percentage of neurotypicals to neuroatypicals (or neuro-spicy, as someone said a while ago) is pretty close to 50/50. It makes sense, though, doesn\u2019t it? Historically, the go-getters were neurotypical, because they were actually able to go out and do the things that we tend to find difficult. As a result, we were told that we were lazy, that we just needed to work harder, etc etc etc. My uncle was born around 1950, and never learned to read when he was young. Most likely had a learning disability like dyslexia, these are common in my family. But instead of sitting down and helping him, the teachers (well, nuns-Catholic school) just kept passing him on to the higher grades, telling him he needed to apply himself and work harder. I\u2019m not sure how old he was before he was finally able to read, but I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t until he entered public school (8th grade). Your brother\u2019s unfortunate attitude sounds very similar. It\u2019s also something that is still way too common. I was lucky to be diagnosed when I was 10 (1991), especially since girls were diagnosed way less often than boys in those days. \n\nBut here\u2019s the deal: you\u2019re ending up in the hospital because you\u2019re having trouble remembering to take your medication. It sounds like you\u2019re a diabetic, which as you know, can become very serious if you aren\u2019t taking your medication properly. My advice aligns with a previous commenter: set an alarm and then abide by it. If you have an iPhone, you can set up medication reminders in the health app. If not, or even in addition, smart phones have alarms you can set up and customize. Set more than one to remind you. The idea here is to create a habit. You could also do other things at the same time to help you remember, such as making sure you have your meds and taking them whenever you eat lunch, or before you leave for work, or anything, really, that you do every day. This part is important, because on days that are different, you will forget. So make sure you associate it with something you do every day. Keep yourself accountable. There are tons of mindfulness apps that you can look into that will help you to build those habits. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t already, please see a therapist or psychiatrist. Having a mental health professional by your side can make it easier to find things that will work for you. This is so important because your mental health affects your physical health, and not just because it\u2019s hard to remember to take your meds. There are so many great resources available to help you survive in this neurotypical world. Please find someone to help you.

They can be useful as a tool but are not effective or healthy for consisent long term treatment, likewise neither is cannabis though again in moderation it has its use.

After about a year of trying different meds, I'm now on the lowest dose of Ritalin by my own choice (5mg 1 to 2 times a day). I asked if I could start the Klonopin back up because it helped with anxiety too. He agreed, but has been giving off vibes that he doesn't approve. I had practically a whole bottle left of the Klonopin from last time (which should tell you something!), so I was using that up before he wrote a new RX. I just sent in a refill request the other day with my other prescription. The other one got filled, but not the Klonopin. I emailed my Dr and he said he'd send it tomorrow. Then an hour later I got another email saying for patients taking both, he's gonna require an annual drug test. I know it's silly, but I started crying. \n\nI'm lucky in the sense that addiction is one of the problems I don't have. I don't take any recreational drugs, and I don't even overdo alcohol. It hurts to be treated like this, especially since I've been seeing this doctor for so long.  I didn't know what to think, because if it was so standard why didn't he bring it up during our last appointment? Why ignore a refill request and be all shady about it? If he thinks I'm an addict, then he should have just said no at the appointment and been direct about it. So I told him I'd come in right away for the screening. Well I must have passed some test of his, because then he was all like ohhhh there's no rush! Maybe just do it in a couple of months with your next appointment.\n\nPart of me wants to just stop taking the Klonopin again. Even tho it helps my quality of life, and I was on it for 7 years, so I know I won't have issues with abuse.

I thought that was going to be great.\n\nIt wasn't. I need that structure. While, I was still viewed well at work I didn't like the experience. There were too many up in the air, open ended projects. To many things left to \"when you have time\". I work from home and I would just not work for an entire day. Because there was not status meeting the next day. I could just say I ran into some trouble and we moved on.\n\n\\---\n\nPersonally, I view ADHD as a hindrance to processes and not a hindrance to ability. I know I can do things but I have no ability to do the things that allow me to get there. Since programming was interesting to me ADHD got out of the way a bit and I was able to learn the skill.

I first tried posting in r/ADHD, aand my post got automoderated, I thought it followed the rules but I suppose it didn't. I firstly would assume posting about this here wouldn't be appropriate, but I did see that someone else posted here about a similar question and there was no backlash towards it.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm  not seeking for a self diagnosis here, I'm just wondering if I should  seek a doctor to see if I do have ADHD. I don't really want to make a  pointless doctors trip if I don't need to, so I'm really just asking if  this is normal human conditioning or if it's not.\n\nFor  most of my life I never thought about if I had ADHD or not, I assumed  not. Though, in recent years, I've started to question it some, and  seeing posts on this subreddit makes me question it more, because I feel  like some of my behaviors line up with what y'all share about.\n\nThese symptoms may perhaps be the cause of some other mental thing, or maybe it's just normal for people to be like this.\n\nI'm  not a super erratic person, I'm fairly reserved and in my head usually,  but I am fairly fidgety at times. At home I struggle a lot with  motivation. I procrastinate on anything that I NEED to do. I have  personal projects I'm trying to complete, and I ever only really work on  them when I get a burst of motivation, otherwise it's incredibly  difficult to make myself work on something at home. Relatively, I'm not  sure how easily distracted I get, but it does seem that often I will  doze off in my head, or impulsively check Discord, often I will start  browsing through YouTube while trying to work on projects. When I do get  bursts of motivation for my projects, it can be short lasted, or it can  last for a week or longer. Once I got into a new hobby and I was super  motivated, spent an entire week working on the hobby. Was working on it  from the moment I woke up to when I went to sleep, sometimes forgetting  to eat. Now, with the same hobby, I will occasionally get a burst of  motivation where I work on it a lot, then I stop for weeks or months at a  time. Or, with the same hobby, I will get bored of one project and  leave it unfinished, and then start a new one.\n\nSchool  is a bit different, although I'm still fairly quiet and don't usually  speak during class unless spoken to. A bit of context about my school,  my school is mostly self paced as long as you aren't getting too far  behind. I do quite well in school, but I struggle to keep on pace and  fall behind sometimes. I hadn't really thought about why that happens  until now, but it seems that I doze off quite often and sorta get lost  in a train of thought. Then I will snap back to it and continue working  on my stuff for a few minutes, then get lost in thought again. Although,  this might be because of drowsiness from insufficient sleep, as I  struggle to keep a consistent sleep schedule. Luckily, my current school  doesn't have homework (but you can work at home to get ahead if you  want), but I used to go to a school that did give out homework. I found  that school to be absolutely miserable only because of the homework, I  was very stressed, and fairly depressed.\n\n(I  also struggle to read books at times. I often will have to read  sentences several times before it actually processes in my brain, and I  will get very easily distracted while doing so).\n\nI  always saw these things as me being lazy or unmotivated, but it feels  no matter how hard I try I can't bring myself to do things that I don't  feel like doing (Until that thing starts to become a necessity that I  do. In other words, I procrastinate until the last minute) It's always a  huge mental battle.\n\nAgain, I'm  not asking for a diagnosis, I'm just wondering if, based on this  information, I should seek medical help. Because I'm not really sure if  this information shows signs of ADHD or maybe some other mental  disorder. I know I should probably just go see a doctor about it,  although I feel like I should have proper reasoning to go.\n\nThank you to anybody who's read through this and or replies, it's greatly appreciated.", "ups": 3, "permalink": "/r/adhdmeme/comments/16gigln/should_i_look_into_if_i_have_adhd_or_not/", "num_comments": 17}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I will be honest...

Firstly, the medication is in your system for a lot longer than it works for due to an effect called tachyphylaxis.  Tachyphylaxis is a very short term tolerance created by exposure to a drug.  I don't think it is a common phenomenon, but it's a known effect with amphetamines.  Secondly, quite a bit of the amphetamine in your system isn't metabolized at all, but is excreted unchanged.  I don't know if this happens with the lisdexamfetamine itself, but it definitely happens with the dextroamphetamine metabolite.  It's supposed to be up to 50% of the drug and the amount is supposed to depend on urinary pH (this is where the whole \"vitamin C makes the meds less effective\" thing comes in, but I think it takes a mega dose of vitamin C for this to occur).\n\nStill, there are different enzymes that metabolize different drugs.

My fave is Sunday Riley Autocorrect.\n\n- Invest in a good under eye brightener to pair with your concealer. If your skin is deep, try something with an orange undertone, and if your skin is light, try peach. Bobbi Brown and Nars both make brilliant versions with a ton of different shades.\n\n- Invest in a good quality concealer that is lightweight with high coverage. A lot of heavily pigmented ones are too thick (ahem, Shape Tape) and they can make things worse. The best ones I\u2019ve found: Lanc\u00f4me Teint Idole concealer and Natasha Denona\u2019s new concealer. \n\n- lightly (and I do mean LIGHTLY) set your under eyes with a brightening under eye powder, and an extremely fine milled loose powder. Hourglass Veil Powder is excellent, as is their Diffused Light Ambient Powder. Pat McGrath\u2019s under eye setting powder is also brilliant. A light touch is key\u2026.if you use too much, it\u2019ll highlight the natural lines we all have under our eyes.\n\n- place blush higher on the cheekbone. It pulls attention up and away from under eyes.\n\n- if your brows are in good shape and well defined, this will help under eyes from looking dark.\n\n- the most important one: ACCEPTANCE. I guarantee they look worse to you than anyone else. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nLastly: under eye filler can have amazing results, but there are a lot of risks involved, which is why I\u2019ve never done it.

Mom, dad &amp; stepdad had multiple skin cancers on fave and mist on the left. I had uv filter film put on all windows. You can get clear or dark. The \u201ccolor\u201d is not the issue. It is the filter strength. I git 99%. It keeps car cooler outside too (although-again, it\u2019s FL!!) But my mom has the same SUV I have but no filter. My skin sizzles whenever we take hers. I think my brother &amp; I may tint as a treat for xmas. It was about $400 for a tech to cone to my house and do a midsize SUV about 2 yrs ago. \n\nHope something might help.

A true allergic reaction to hyaluronic acid is extremely rare. If you experience stinging or burning when applying an HA product, this may be a sign of a compromised skin barrier.\n\nAs a licensed aesthetician, when I trained in microneedling by an NP, I was taught that only pure hyaluronic acid should be applied to skin immediately after a microneedling treatment. This is due to the compromised nature of the skin post-procedure; there is swelling, erythema, and thousands of open micro-wounds present in the skin. Not all providers of microneedling do it this way, and I am by no means saying they're doing it wrong. (My own provider does it differently.) However, the benefit of only using pure HA post-procedure is that you reduce the risk of irritation, allergic reactions, and granulomas. My point here is that if pure hyaluronic acid is well tolerated and even considered ideal for compromised post-procedure skin, then it should be well tolerated by the vast majority of people, including those with sensitive skin.\n\nSo why do a not-so-insignificant portion of people claim they get irritation from HA products? There's a few reasons:\n\n-First off, as I mentioned before, their skin may already be sensitized. If this is the case, you may not get lasting irritation from HA products, but you probably experience stinging or burning upon initial application, and your HA may not be the only product that causes this sensation.\n\n- Secondly, while your typical large molecule HA is anti-inflammatory, it is a known fact that low molecular weight HA can actually be pro-inflammatory. The exact mechanism as to why it functions in this manner is not entirely known, but the leading hypothesis is that it triggers a type of unnecessary immune response. In addition, low molecular weight HA is a penetration enhancer, meaning it could also allow potential irritants to get deeper into the skin.  It is often listed as hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid on ingredient labels. Due to an unhealthy obsession with product penetration, it's become much more popular in formulations than good old classic hyaluronic acid ,even though it can be more problematic. Those who have experienced irritation from HA products in the past MAY (key word: being may) actually be able to use HA and see the benefits if they are able to avoid products with hydrolyzed HA, nano HA etc.\n\n\nI hope this information is helpful.", "ups": 20, "depth": 1, "author": "gracespraykeychain", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "That's what I just wanted to write.\nIn 2018/19 niacinamide had a huge hype (like hyaluronic acid before) and every company put it into their products.\nSo a) you end up with more than the necessary percentage, if you combine products.

Oke might argue that if you lose collagen at an equal rate of 1% every year one might say that if you start getting wrinkles at 30 you have lost roughly 10%.

Keep doing it long enough and you end up with a fold, like a sheet of paper. That you can 'fix' with Botox but it's not permanent because Botox will wear off. (If you do Botox chronically I guess you could call it 'permanent' but that's not what you mean.)\n\nThen you have collagen. Collagen production does not only decrease naturally with age and after menopause (by 1-2% per year), but the thickness and positioning of collagen fibres changes. IIRC young skin (20-30 yo) is up to 70% collagen. At 70-80yo, skin is about 50% collagen. \n\nSo older people not only have fewer collagen fibres, but they're placed haphazardly and the fibres are thinner. As a result, skin surface can appear 'wrinkled' with uneven grooves. Less collagen means thinner skin which is less able to hold on to moisture, which leads to dry skin leads to increased appearance of wrinkles. Collagen has a half-life of 15 years which is why any damage is noticeable.\n\nNow your question 'why damage' is partially explained by skin glycation. Glycation is in part simply natural because we're living things and will die. \n\n*Increased* glycation however is lifestyle related. Smoking, UVA exposure, insulin resistance as occurs in obesity, and a diet high in advanced glycation products are all known to contribute. Regular exercise (both resistance and endurance) are known to have beneficial effects on collagen synthesis in skin and reduce glycation.

So I'm not talking about the stuff that Botox fixes.\n\nI'm talking about lines where the skin is flat but broken from collagen damage. Like crow's feet or thin forehead lines that are there despite the forehead being flat and relaxed.\n\nIn my view if that collagen is repaired and you leave the dermatologists office with smooth skin and never get UVA damage again and never squint again or raise your eyebrows again and therefore don't contribute further external damage then I see no reason why these areas would break again while the skin on your arm or whatever would not. That simply does not make sense to me.\n\nLike I said before, if this was related to general ageing then you'd have the same lines all over your face and body. But we don't. We only get them where skin is moving. And I really do not see why you'd get these wrinkles again if you eliminate that moving. \n\nSo to me those treatments must be permanent.

Obviously during the time you don't use it it is not actively contributing and perhaps an acne outbreak may happen, but you keep the 'progress to date', as it were, and it is perfectly possible to stop and start as life demands. Just remember to go back to 'low and slow' when you resume and not straight back to whatever you were using before.\n\nJust FYI, the TTC/Pregnancy links for the CREAM are not established because it's not medically ethical to experiment on pregnant women so they take the 'safe not sorry' route. Iso-tret, the pill form of a far more potent tret (best known as Accutane) IS a severe risk for TTC and fetal malformation in the first trimester especially, and as it is linked to high Vitamin A levels (a fat soluble, and thus fat stored vitamin) it can take time to 'clear' from the body, too, which is why that must be stopped about 6 months before TTC. However, this is a more powerful form and internally delivered. There is no solid evidence that tret cream will cause issues and, in fact, it's highly unlikely to do so. The amounts delivered through skin absorption are ridiculously low compared to an iso-tret course.\n\nI mention this NOT to say don't come off of it, but rather as reassurance that if you, say, accidentally fall pregnant while using the cream simply stopping once you are aware is enough. You are highly unlikely to face any fetal malformation issues with just the cream treatment. Also to explain why you will find a lot of disagreement from docs. Some take the 'super safe' route and ban it entirely, but that's not on established evidence, it's a precaution. Many feel that past the 2nd trimester (after most of the important flashpoints of fetal development are in place) there's no risk and they're LIKELY to be right, like massively likely, but it's not a chance everyone is comfortable with.\n\nI've never really understood the breastfeeding ban at all. Again, it's more hyper caution than anything, and that's reasonable. It's a baby, who want's to FAFO? But the risk point for Vitamin A and pregnancy is fetal malformation, which is obviously not going to happen in a newborn, and the chances of enough trace Vitamin A getting into breastmilk to cause any issue at all is minuscule. But again, it's safer to issue the ban then risk an issue.\n\nOf course, this also nicely highlights a major failing in medical testing overall- the eradication of women from test environments as we're 'too difficult'. This is what led to issues like the now-notorious thalidomide babies, as it was only tested as safe on men. This has led to the swing the other way- blanket bans on anything risky at all. Which is more safe, but again in the wider sense very damaging to women's health care outcomes and places a strict and mostly unfair burden on pregnant women based only on 'what ifs' instead of them being able to act with firm medical research and guidance. For eg, many pregnant women are barred from their necessary chronic meds and forced to suffer the consequences with no clear research that this is necessary. As always, we are expected to suck it up and suffer. However, how DO you ethically test in pregnancy?\n\nIt's a whole can of worms. I mention as general interest in healthcare outcomes for women. That's not a burden an individual woman wanting to progress to her babies needs to tackle, though it's a worrying thing in the wider medical sense. My advice would always be safe over sorry for the individual, though I'd love to see better focus on women's healthcare in general so we can act with real science data and not 'what-ifs' and the idea we're mystery beings.", "ups": 15, "depth": 2, "author": "CopperPegasus", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "It\u2019s of course up to you what you feel comfortable with, but my dermatologist and midwife were both fine with me using tretinoin for the first three weeks of every cycle while I was TTC.

I know it seems ridiculous, but my face is dramatically lifted after doing it for a couple weeks. Can help.\n\nSo can lymph drainage massages - just be sure not to accidentally massage too hard and make your salivary glands swell, causing a worse double chin.\n\nIf it is partially due to salivary gland swelling, which happens when we eat too much salt and don\u2019t drink enough water, then cutting down salt and drinking enough water helps. Drinking a lot of water also helps to cut down fluid retention, which can cause face puffiness.\n\nDo you grind your teeth or clench your jaw? I used to get chipmunk cheeks from grinding. A mouthguard at night and being cognizant of whether you\u2019re clenching your jaw and inflaming it throughout the day can also help.\n\nI also get a swollen face from allergies, and since going on allergy meds my face is a lot less puffy.\n\n\nTLDR; drink a lot of water, lymph drainage massage, face yoga, ensure you\u2019re not clenching your jaw, check for allergies.\n\nIf none of that works, it\u2019s just the way your fat is deposited on your body.

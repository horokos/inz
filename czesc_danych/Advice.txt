But also because this admission early on should serve to move him out of a defensive mental posture. \n\nMen and women argue differently, and this is because we\u2019re wired differently, educated differently and shown different behavior patterns that we model our own after.

Hell be building models of what you could have done, and if/how he should forgive you. \n\nListen, it sucks, but no man has ever heard \u201cwe should talk\u201d and felt good about that sentence, unless he was already spoiling for a fight. \n\nWhen you start the discussion be open, honest and vulnerable.

Let me stress, you are **not** asking how he feels about it, or about your being hurt. . . . . . your goal is to understand how he came to first hear it, why he chose to write it down, and what it means to him. \n\nYou can get into those later, but get your context first. It\u2019s only then that you can have an informed opinion about how you feel. I know, you feel hurt, probably objectified, dehumanized, and betrayed. But if you say that you are pushing him towards his own negative response. \n\nHis inner monologue will tell him he either can, or cannot fix this, and if it\u2019s the later, his negative self talk will come out to play. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything right, I\u2019m a failure, I don\u2019t even get the girl, I am the monster.\u201d Ect. \n\nThat helps no one, and it also serves to drive a wedge between you two.

It does seem, based on her account of the relationship being a generally healthy and loving one, that this was more about him/his insecurities and him trying to find a way to express himself in a way that made sense to him/he was more comfortable with. Maybe he\u2019s a bit more uncomfortable with more emotional ways of expressing himself to himself? Just one potential take. He sounds to be good at showing you he cares about you, but he\u2019s journaling/writing a mantra based around his insecurities by the sounds of it. I think u/AlmostABastard had a great way to go about it. Obviously every individual is different and I handle conversations with different people depending on what I perceive they would be most receptive to, but this is what I would view a constructive approach if in a loving relationship w someone.

Share with him why going to college is so important to you and how it aligns with your personal growth, career prospects, and overall future. Help him understand that education can open doors for new opportunities and contribute positively to your relationship as well. Communicate your goals and aspirations, and emphasize how attending college can bring both personal and mutual benefits.\n\nSeeking support from loved ones can also be incredibly helpful during this time. Reach out to close friends, family members, or mentors who can provide guidance and perspective. Hearing positive experiences from others who have pursued education might help your boyfriend see the value in it.\n\nWhen discussing the topic, try to find a compromise that addresses your boyfriend's concerns while still allowing you to pursue your educational goals. Explore options like online or part-time programs that offer flexibility in terms of time and financial commitments.

They are not critical thinkers, they are not looking at how Society has changed, and apply scientific principles. They will accept the scholastic authority as a reputable source simply because they have been called the authority.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on the pratfalls of a \u201cfor profit\u201d education system.

I think the first thing you need to do is break \u201cstudying\u201d down into short and attainable tasks. If it\u2019s not something you\u2019re in the habit of doing, it\u2019s going to be extremely hard to just sit down and say \u201cok, I\u2019m going to study now\u201d. You can try any combination of the following approaches:\n\n1) if you\u2019re using a textbook, set yourself a (realistic) number of pages to read and take notes from, or a (realistic) number of pages of your existing notes to revise. I\u2019m talking, like, \u201cI\u2019m going to read these 5 pages this afternoon, and I\u2019m going to get up and have a stretch and refill my drink after every major section\u201d. \n\n2) set yourself a time limit, and then break that time down. Eg. \u201cI\u2019m going to study this particular biology unit for an hour, in 15-minute bursts with 5 minutes in between each one,\u201d and do several of those hour-long breaks.\n\n3) write yourself a weekly schedule, so that your studying blocks become an extension of your school day. Each week, pencil in SPECIFICALLY what you are going to study then.\n\n\nMost importantly, though, learn to work smarter, not harder. Lots of kids struggle in school despite working really hard because they are inefficient - for example, they decide they\u2019re going to \u201cstudy\u201d the whole textbook, cover to cover, and make endless (useless) notes just regurgitating the content. This is both ineffective and incredibly dull. Instead, use the syllabus for whatever you are studying, so you know EXACTLY what you actually need to know, and EXACTLY how you need to frame that knowledge in order to get points for it in an exam. Then you can just go through the syllabus and ask yourself \u201ccan I do this?\u201d and clearly identify areas where you need to study more. This will cut that 700-page monstrous book into a series of attainable tasks. For humanities subjects where \u201cknowledge\u201d isn\u2019t cut and dry and it\u2019s more about skills, discussion with peers - or online - can be a really productive way of learning to relay information/arguments in a coherent way, with evidence.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "dreamofdandelions", "replies": [{"selftext": "thanks so much this helped :) i\u2019ll take on ur advice", "ups": 1, "depth": 1, "author": "pzzypoppin", "replies": [{"selftext": "Thank you for confirming that /u/dreamofdandelions has provided helpful advice for you. 1 point awarded.", "ups": 1, "depth": 2, "author": "AdviceFlairBot", "replies": []}]}]}, {"selftext": "Lots of good advice here.

It\u2019s laughable to me now. Through the humility of realising I\u2019m not perfect, I learnt how to be a good partner, support and be there for my partner, provide in a way beyond financial means. I\u2019m now in a beautiful, healthy relationship, built on trust and understanding. I\u2019m loved for who I am, and it is genuine , real, love.

{"post": {"title": "I want to have a baby but should I?", "subreddit": "Advice", "selftext": "First post so apologies if I just ramble. I\u2019m just gonna info dump. \n\nSo basically as the title says I (35f) want to have a baby. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my biological clock ticking or what but I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while now but the last week or so I\u2019ve been consumed by the thought. \nI feel like I\u2019m at the point where if I don\u2019t do this I will regret it and hate myself for the rest of my life. \nI\u2019m not one to confide in friends and family and ask for advice about personal things so I wanted to ask impartial strangers first. \n\nI know at my age it would be considered a geriatric pregnancy, and also my weight could be a complicating factor. I will talk to my dr about that before I conceive. \n\nI am a single lesbian and want to stay that way. Ideally I wanted to co parent with a male friend but they are all duds (genetically speaking) so that\u2019s out. I have found a group for people looking for sperm donors and those looking to donate so I think I\u2019m good there. \n\nMy 2 areas for concern is money and support/childcare\n\nI\u2019m working a dead end manual labour job. Working full time arvo shift. I\u2019m struggling physically now and would have to move areas once I\u2019m pregnant. I make ends meet ok atm but I do go without sometimes. I also have a mortgage. I have no skills beyond this job and any kind of decent job is beyond my reach I feel. I have looked into what govt assistance is available and I should be good for mat leave plus a  lump sum. There is also a parenting payment but that would be a last last resort as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a liveable payment. \nI have some savings to get what the baby needs before it\u2019s born but I\u2019m more worried about day to day expenses. I know babies are expensive and it only gets worse as they get older. Plus childcare once I go back to work! I do feel as if I would get by but I\u2019m still scared about what if I don\u2019t? Is it irresponsible of my to have a baby if I\u2019m not sure I can afford one?\n\nMy hours of work don\u2019t really work for professional childcare and there\u2019s not much if any wiggle room to change them. My dad and his family all work full time plus they live an hour away so too far to ask them to babysit. \nMy mum works and is cranky and old beyond her years. She was known as mean Aunty ****\nTo my younger cousins. I think she would help out where she could but wouldn\u2019t be available all the time. She yells at her dog to be quiet all the time, I don\u2019t want my baby around that. My brother lives with her and is unemployed and possibly unemployable due to being on the autism spectrum and can barely look after himself. My grandmother is nearing 90 and feeling her age. Most of my extended family works varying hours and I feel at best it would be like playing pass the parcel with baby to find care. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I know these are valid reasons for my not to have a child but it hurts my heart and makes me cry to think that these things are standing in my way of fulfilling my dream. I\u2019m not getting younger, I don\u2019t have time to wait around till I can afford a child. It\u2019s now or never. \nDo I give up, knowing that nothing will ever truely fill the void of not having a child?\nDo I need to grow up and get over it, you can\u2019t always get what you want in life?\nOr do I just jump in and figure it all out later. I mean parenting is 90% not knowing what your doing anyway right?\n\nYes I know I should talk to my mum about all this, and I will\u2026. Eventually. After I\u2019ve spoken to my dr and gotten an ok from her.

I am used to my body the way it is. Everything works. My bladder is strong. My teeth are good. Hair is soft and silky. All of that usually goes away when you\u2019re pregnant. The baby literally leeches your nutrients. You can lose your teeth, your hair, nails become brittle, bladder gets weak. \n\n2) they\u2019re EXPENSIVE. You say you know babies can be expensive but do you know HOW expensive? Doctors visits, insurance, diapers, clothes they\u2019re constantly growing out of, food and enrichment activities. schooling and daycare. It\u2019s insane to take all that on solo unless you\u2019re in a really great spot financially and time wise\n\nLastly, my biological clock started ticking too last year. I really thought about whether I wanted to have a baby or truly be child-free because as women our time is limited for child bearing. \n\nAlso, you DO have time. I mean, none of us know how long we have, but like someone else said above, you can help children in different ways than having your own.

You literally live together, all sleep in the same room, work shift together, eat together, play cards together, etc. you spend 24/7 with these people for months. It was odd, you could become best friends offshore for 2 months, and then you get back to land and everyone just goes their separate ways.\n\nWhen i would get off a hitch, and be back home with my bf, it would be hard to turn it off. Id have stories for days. Work stories, or pranking stories.

He has done a series of shoots lately featuring \u201cunconventional\u201d models, more everyday kind of people rather than the traditional professional model physique. This series has given him a lot of professional attention and helped his career. \n\nMy husband has joked with me over the past year, suggesting I should pose for this series. I never took him seriously, but he told me over the summer that both his father and mother have mentioned this to him as well, but didn\u2019t want to mention it to me, assuming I would probably be uncomfortable with the idea (his shots involve some nudity). \n\nI told my husband last month that I\u2019d actually be interested in this if they are serious, as I\u2019m not getting any younger. Long story short, I met with my father in law, we talked it over, and I agreed to go to his studio and do the shoot. \n\nI was BEYOND nervous that day, to the point I almost chickened out. The idea of him seeing me undressed, judging me, etc, was really getting to me. My husband agreed to accompany me to the shoot, which helped, and I went through with it. I was in various states of undress. He was so great, it was a fun experience. \n\nLast week the proofs became available, and my father in law called me right away, so happy, saying that a couple of them were \u201cbreathtaking.\u201d I came over to see them, with my husband. And a couple of them really were something! I looked nervous and shy in many of them (which he said was evident but actually added to the photos considerably), but in one, where I am shot sideways leaning over a pedestal, in a right angle, he said was one of the best shots he\u2019s taken in years. I was so flattered and happy. (And it really does look cool!)\n\nThe whole thing was worth it, I have to admit. The thing is, though, that my father in law has said the one photo is good enough to display publicly, and there may even be a market for it (he would share proceeds with me).\n\nI am hesitating, though! This has all happened so fast, and I don\u2019t know if I want this photo of me out in the world. How should I think about this?

{"post": {"title": "Special Needs Adult in My Neighborhood is Driving Me Nuts. What to Do?", "subreddit": "Advice", "selftext": "I live in a small community, where people grow up here, leave the nest for college and early adulthood, then come back to raise their kids. I didn't grow up here, but we moved here to raise our kids.\n\nThere's a special needs adult woman (late 30s) who grew up here and never left. I would describe her as being a 12-year-old in a grown woman's body. Nobody ever talks about the fact that she has special needs, and she seems unaware that she has special needs. She's the elephant in this large room. She lives with her parents, both retired. \n\nShe has a sister that is my age who grew up, left the nest, and came back to raise her kids. She never talks about her sister. In fact, I just learned from a mutual friend that she actively gets cagey and maybe angry if people want to talk to her about her sister. Nobody ever sees them interact in public. They do not appear to have a relationship outside of family dinners at their parents' house now and then.\n\nBefore I was fully aware of this lady's intensity, I let her befriend me (at some point, she ended up with my cell phone number, and I cannot, for the life of me, remember giving it to her). I initially would walk with her now and then, which was OK because it would happen maybe once or twice a week. Then, it became a constant \"ping ping ping ping\" of texts and phone calls asking multiple times a day if I wanted to go for a walk. Now, it's developed to a point where I want to hide from her, I have her muted on texts, I have had to restrict her on social media because she actually lies in wait to see when I am active before she pings me with texts (it had gotten to a point where I wasn't sharing as much as I normally would because I knew she'd message/text me when she saw it), and I don't want to walk with her ever. She's making me incredibly uncomfortable and refuses to accept any sort of boundaries I establish. Unfortunately, I can't even go for a walk by myself without running the risk of running into her because she is ALWAYS out, and all the roads are connected/on the way to my house. She's actively LOOKING for me. If she sees my kids out playing, she asks them where I am. It's creepy for them.\n\nThis woman wanders around outside all day (sometimes with her dog, sometimes not because it's too many miles for the dog). She steals drinks out of municipal building fridges (I know this because she tells me she does it). There are cameras on these buildings, so it is likely they are aware. Maybe they don't care. She's admitted to peeing outdoors in the neighborhood (often) because she's out all day and needs to go. \n\nI have lost my temper and snapped on her a couple of times after she showed up at my house. This happened after I was specific that I wasn't ready to go for a walk yet (or that I couldn't go), but she showed up anyway. She backed off each time, but she dials the intensity back up every time. I don't really know what else to do because it's apparently taboo to even suggest that she's an issue to the family. She really needs enrichment/activities/other people like her in her life, and her parents could probably make it happen. They just choose not to. In fact, they go out of town for weeks sometimes and leave her here to drive everyone extra crazy (that's when she gets next-level because I think they actually do encourage her to stay home more while they are home). There are even programs in the area that could connect her with work or a place to hang out with other people like her which provides transportation, but . . . for some reason they are not doing that. \n\nI asked her once if she has ever considered getting a job, and she said she used to have a couple. She got fired both times because she said \"the managers said she was rude to customers,\" so I guess that's why they stopped trying to make that work? The point is, they have tried it before and stopped, it would seem. (BTW, can confirm that she is capable of rudeness.)\n\nI see two options: I either tell her to leave me alone, or I go full ghost on her. Either way, I still will likely run into her all day every day because she is always out, and I have a dog to walk. What am I missing? Are there other options? I'm fairly confident most people ghost her or tell her to eff off. She pushes until people snap. \n\nI told her that I would let her know if/when I was available for walks, but she ignores that and constantly asks all day every day if I want to go. Ignoring her texts and calls does not seem to be slowing her down. All standard forms of communication/explanation do not compute with this one.\n\nI don't understand why this intensity is solely for me. There are other nice people here (apparently not nice enough to walk with her, though), but for some reason, it's gotta be me. I don't get it. I'm not that great. (I am also a woman, and I don't think she is gay\u2014if that's where your mind went.)", "ups": 22, "permalink": "/r/Advice/comments/16rt5pr/special_needs_adult_in_my_neighborhood_is_driving/", "num_comments": 31}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Do you have Adult Protective Services where you live?

Her normal speech was difficult to understand and she spoke very loud almost sounding more like yelling.   When we first ran into her we befriended her and talked to her and were very nice to her.   But that eventually backfired as she'd come visit us and our dog whenever she saw us and continue attempting to talk with us even after we'd make it clear that we needed to move on.  She'd even frequently do this when we were sitting in  our backyard (area had no fences) to talk and visit our dog and wouldn't leave even when we asked her to.  This became a real problem as we always like to sit on our patio when it's nice out and she'd even do this when we had company over and really didn't want to deal with her interruptions and her ignoring requests to stop and leave.    A big turning point in our approach was a time when we were not home and she came to visit our patio, saw our dog in the window and opened our door and let the dog out to visit with.  We returned home after a neighbor told us our dog was outside barking and our door was half open - we confirmed it was her from our cameras.\n\nSince she ignored any reasonable request to not approach us on our patio and to leave us alone when we asked her to, it eventually lead to having to be very direct in sort of a mean way.  I didn't like to do it but eventually I literally had to start literally yelling at her to not come into our back yard at all.   We still would occasionally have a short conversation with her if we saw her while we were out and about in the neighborhood, but in order to end those conversations I'd have to raise my voice and tell her we need to stop visiting and continue on.   \n\nI felt bad doing so but being loud, direct and with a clear message as to limits and boundaries was the only way to coexist in our neighborhood.  \n\nYou may not need to go to the extent of loudness and yelling as we did to get the message across, but you do need to be direct and give a clear message of your limits and boundaries.  Keep in mind that because of her difficulties you may have to use phrases that are very direct and would be considered impolite with people that are not impaired.    For example if she approaches you when you don't want to talk you can clearly and loudly say:  \"I can't talk right now, you have to leave me alone - go away\"\n\nFor instance tell her clearly that she should not call you on your phone and that you are blocking her calls so you will not get them.  Then block her.   You can still occasionally have a short polite conversation when out walking but you need to use a clear phrase like \"OK, we need to stop talking now\" and work to make sure she understands that.  You might need to get a bit loud and mean about it.   Likewise, you can tell her not to talk to your children and tell your children not to talk to her and to come get you when she tries so you can come out and enforce that boundary.", "ups": 3, "depth": 0, "author": "Junkmans1", "replies": [{"selftext": "Oh, wow.

It\u2019s a mixture of impulsivity from their intellectual disability, and a history of neglect that leaves them latching onto strangers *very* intensely and very quickly. They have this imaginary obligation to obsessively reach out to these people, even if told directly not to. \n\nThis makes them a danger to themself because they are also extremely naive and people can manipulate them without even trying. You tell them something, they believe you, even if they change their mind about it 5 seconds later.

If you\u2019re worried about feeling like you\u2019re throwing them in a nursing home, most capable individuals are set up with programs to improve their behaviors and get them to a stabler state of being. They\u2019re then assisted with arranging independent living when they are deemed fit to live alone safely. I\u2019m told the house I\u2019m working at typically has residents staying for 2-6 years depending on their level of functioning and behavior. I think it\u2019s best they\u2019re aware a seemingly neglected disabled adult is trespassing on your property. \n\nThey could help connect her to resources that could get her a proper diagnosis and subsequent treatments, if a group home is not necessary.

My boyfriend (30m) and me (25f) have been together for 2,5 years and at the beginning of the relationship he had some issues with mantaining erection. I have somewhat of a low self esteem, so I took it to heart a little bit, but he assured me it's not because of me and that he is very attracted to me etc. Shortly after the problems stopped with the occasional occurences which I handled (as far as I know) pretty good, didn't make a big deal out of it, reassured him it's okay and joked a little to lighten the mood. Things were going great and I've always trusted him, never had any urge to check his phone or anything like that. And he's always been a very loving and trustworthy bf. Recently I discovered erectile disfunction pills in the trash can and my heart sank. I confronted him about them and he told me he ordered them shortly after our first problems and that he uses them ocasionally (he took aprox. 25 pills in 2 years). He never told me about them and even tried hiding them (very badly lol). I see this as a huge breach of trust, since that issue concerns me aswell (if I'm his only sexual partner ofc) and I feel like this should've been a conversation 2 years ago. We talked things through and left it at that. But my mind keeps reliving every sex we had, especially the ones when he was extra hard and questioning everything. Last week I found condoms in his drawer (which we never use, since I've had an IUD for the last year and a half) and he said he just never threw them out and uses them occasionally for masturbation. Today he got a messenger notification (he uses msg only for talking to me and our friend group, occasionally his mother. He only has me and his mom added on FB lol) and I checked my phone and no one sent anything in the group. Now I'm really fighting the urge to check his phone, which I know is insane and would never do that. But I'm also spiraling quite a bit.\r  \n\r  \nSo my question(s) is/are this: What would you do?

If he was considering it in any way he would've reached out or exchanged contacts for sure. Not to say he didn't like you, didn't find you attractive, etc...but he prob just isnt open to a relationship and assumed you werent either. In any other context I wouldn't say it's desperate to try and reach out to someone but this particular community has a certain way of moving that if you're not careful will waste your time.

Tap Insta notification see that her DMs had messages, just her female friends no big deal, look down some and see two different male names(one with a profile pic) but the thing that arose my suspicion more was that both of their names were set to silent notifications. So I won\u2019t see on her phone when they message.

Not sure how to feel/ if I believe him", "subreddit": "Advice", "selftext": "So I (20m) was at the gym today with a friend. We were talking about something and somehow he told me that one of his girl friends  doesn\u2019t like me. I\u2019ve only met this girl a handful of times. I don\u2019t really like her but haven\u2019t really ever talked to her. He also said that her friend group went to high school with me and they take pictures of me when they see me around campus (not to talk down on myself, but I was basically a nobody in high school, which was 2 years ago. And rarely talked to girls. Also there\u2019s not even too too many people from my HS that go to my college, and even less that I talked to). He also told me that thats how people generally view me, as a \u201cturbo incel\u201d. In his words. He said that I only sexualize women and always stare at their ass which I don\u2019t believe to be true. I\u2019m going over to his apartment this week to watch a movie for class and he said that one of his roommates doesn\u2019t like me and asked when I\u2019m coming over so he can avoid me. \n\nI honestly find all this hard to believe. Here\u2019s my reasonings. About his girl friend, I barely talked to her last year and haven\u2019t seen her since. I\u2019m not that important of a person to warrant secretly taking pictures of me around campus, especially after a year. \n\nHis roommate comes up and talks to me when he sees me in the gym. I feel like I can generally tell when people are being fake and I don\u2019t get those vibes from him. I also don\u2019t know why if hes friends with his roommate he would tell me that his friend doesn\u2019t like me, that feels like a personal secret you don\u2019t tell others, especially the person it\u2019s about. \n\nNow about my friend. I met him last year. I didn\u2019t like him at first. He\u2019s always been bad at first impressions. Other people say the same thing. I also realized towards the end of the year that he was just an overall negative person so stopped talking to him. Others thought the same thing. He\u2019s in one of my classes this year and seems to be better so I\u2019ve been talking to him. He\u2019s never really had luck with women and most people I know don\u2019t seem to like him or the vibes he gives off. \n\nNow I\u2019ve never been in a relationship and don\u2019t have many (if any) girl friends, but I don\u2019t think I have a negative view on women or over sexualize or hate them or whatever the \u201cincel community\u201d is about. Im just not the best at talking to people I don\u2019t know which makes it hard to meet others. \n\nSorry, that was really long. But given all that, should I worry about what others think of me?

You can't hang out with him because it is unhealty for you. \n\nAlso I think this exacly what he wants. He wants you to feel bad, he wants you on edge and to doub yourself. So he can make fun of you even more. Some people both men and women are just toxic and need to hurt others to feel better about themself. We can't change that but we can cut then out of there live.\n\nOther (non toxic) people probally just think you are shy or don't even notice you. We don't see most of the people at busy places or when we are busy ourself. This is because actively progressing all those people will be to much for our brain. It does not mean you are anything less than other just that people are busy with there own lives. I already forget how the people I saw today look and even if most of them where women or men. As long as you don't show behavior that stands out both good or bad you are just a other stranger to people that don't know you.\n\nThe only people that think that way about a person for no reason are people that are actively looking for targets to make fun of or to bad mouth.

Where they kind  teach you about sex and also help you lose your virginity.\n\nFor the past year or two, I have had a glow up and I have gotten a lot more populair and have got way more chances to flirt and talk to women, but I am like a magnet that repels intimancy. I grew up in a very strict, abusive  and religious family and over the years I have overcome pretty much all my traumas and fears except for this one. I recognise that my situation is more than just a fear and something more deep rooted. I believe that having intercourse with a proffesional will be a good foundation for my future and also the leap of faith to overcome my anxiety.\n\nThere are other reasons like my busy life, but they are not the cause of my dry sex life\n\n\nThe question now is, how do I make the best of it? What are the best things to ask? What are things you can't really explain, but have to expierence?

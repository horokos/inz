Sorry, kids, but it's true. Many of today's A's would have been B's or B+'s years ago. I'm a high school teacher who has witnessed this from my days in college in the U.S. way back n the 1960s to the present. Today's B- or B would likely have been a C+ back then. There were also relatively few A's back then. I knew \"maybe\" one or two students in my high school graduating class of 250 who had \"straight A\" averages. Today, that is much more common. Today, a B gives students a heart attack. When I was in high school, a B was a very good grade. In fact, it means \"good work\" though not excellent work. \"C\" meant average, acceptable work. You used to be able to go to many colleges even with a C average in high school.\n\nThe top colleges and universities get inundated with straight A (4.0) and A- students with hardly a B to their name. How do they differentiate among them? I imagine they throw darts at a dart board unless they really take the essay part of the application seriously or the letters of recc, and aren't nearly every one of those going to be very complimentary? I'm hard pressed to understand how they differentiate among all these supposedly \"top\" students. \n\nA few top colleges in the U.S. like UCLA and UC Berkeley sometimes get as many as 100,000 applications. The Ivies get 25-50,000 applications. Harvard gets over 50,000. My own little alma mater, Colgate University (in N.Y.), a classic \"small liberal arts college\" that enrolls only 3,000 students, received 21,000 applications last year. It accepted somewhere around 17% -- and even that's a far higher percentage than some Ivies a few of which admit 4%, 5, 6% of their applicants. I think the \"easiest\" Ivy school to get into may be Cornell, but its admissions rate is still below 10%. It's pretty rough out there! Harvard's admission rate is an obscene 4%. In any sane world, that would make almost no sense.\n\nPart of what's happening in the U.S. is there are more and more applications from each student. When I applied to colleges in the 1960s, I applied to three very good colleges and was accepted by all three. Most of my friends applied to just as few colleges, as well. Today, no one does that. Applying to 12, 15, even 20 colleges is not unusual. So colleges are flooded with applications, producing low acceptance rates. Even if 25,000 of the applicants to Harvard were \"qualified\" to go there, there's only room for a small fraction of that. Colgate's first year class is maybe 750 students -- out of 21,000 applicants! Holy smokes! How in the world did dopey little me ever get accepted there? It's a bit silly, really, but everyone is playing the \"If I don't apply, I'll never get in\" game even if they haven't the slightest actual chance of being admitted. \n\nMcGill, an absolutely excellent Canadian university, received over 46,000 applications in 2022, a huge number, but it accepted 46% of them! Another source says 56% but I think that's out of date. That's about the same as Ohio State University. That's around 17,000 acceptances. But McGill is a very large university with about 27,000 undergraduates, much bigger than almost all but the very largest U.S. universities, so it needs to accept a very large number of students. Harvard doesn't. It has about 7,000 undergraduates which is 15% as small as McGill's enormous 46,000. If Harvard challenged McGill to a tug of war, McGill would easily dominate. \n\nOver 50 U.S. colleges have acceptance rates below 12%. And there are mny only \"fairly good\" U.S. colleges which have acceptance rates below 20%, pretty low. By U.S. standards McGill's is a very high acceptance rate. That rate would put McGill way down the acceptance percentage list in the U.S. along with many state universities, around 50th -- along with Baylor, U. of Illinois, U. of Maryland, and so on. So Harvard admits 4% and McGill, the \"Harvard of Canada,\" admits 46%? Yes, strange. \n\nThe U.S. has 335,000,000 people, and a lot of them want to go to college. Canada has a population around 38 million. That is less than the state of California. Sorry if that makes you feel bad! There are 10 schools in the University of California system, including UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, and so on, and all of them except I think UC Riverside and the newest, UC Merced (out in the middle of nowhere), have acceptance rates well below McGill -- as low as 10% at some UC schools. Why? Tremendous competition to get in. California could probably build five more University of California schools and fill them all with very good students. \n\nCanada has far fewer colleges and universities then the U.S. -- a total of around 100. That is not very many. Some of those are not so good, so maybe 50 of them are very good to excellent. Canada has a population that is about 10% of the U.S. so using Canadian numbers, the U.S. should have 500-1000 colleges and universities. Instead, for four-year undergraduate schools, the U.S. close to 3,000 -- and the top 100 get flooded with applications while the lower 2,000 or more accept almost anyone who applies. But most people accepted to these lower schools don't go to them if they got into one of the better, harder to get into, schools. \n\nThese are just two very different systems of higher education, and comparing them is kind of strange indeed. It's interesting to me that over 60% of Canadians get a college education -- but only 40% of Americans do. Maybe we're lazier and stupider than you are? Part of the reason for the difference is a strange popular trend among younger people in the U.S. lately to devalue college education as \"not worth it\". This is because a lot of Americans are idiots who don't realize that a college education leads to far more lifetime income than not getting one. Plus you get an education (who would have thought?) so presumably you get smarter. Plus there's a lot of anxiety over going into debt -- which is a real concern unless your parents are paying. \n\nAnd while top Canadian universities cost very little, top U.S. colleges and universities cost well over $50,000 a year ($55K at Harvard, $60K at Colgate). McGill costs maybe $12,000 a year.

Not everyone will go into formal verification but it is an important component of a lot of software systems.\n2. \"Principles of Functional Programming,\" which looks like their SICP-analogue course. Find me any serious engineer who doesn't think SICP is important in practice and in theory.\n3. Their dedicated data structures course that has a fancy name also. In their words by \"covering a variety of practical applications such as problems in data analysis, graphics, text processing, and the computational sciences.\"\n4. An architecture/microarchitecture course. Not exactly meaningless theory. Would you not be embarrassed as a software engineer if someone asked you how a computer works and all you could say was \"magic?\" To say nothing of the contingent of people who go into digital design and systems programming.\n5. Now a theoretical course. Computability, complexity, automata, etc., a lot of faff I don't blame anyone for calling practically irrelevant. But also covers graph theory/combinatorics/probability/cryptography which simplify, motivate and elucidate a HUGE number of practical engineering problems.\n6. Algorithm analysis, which I'd argue is at worst generally useful excepting issues of NP completeness. You don't need to be an academic to find it useful to characterize algorithms by their space/time complexity. I feel like that's self-evident.\n\nThen they need to take one machine learning/AI course. They show seven interesting-looking courses as options including computer vision, deep learning, NLP, and robotic kinematics. Then one domain elective which is fulfilled by courses on graphics programming, software construction/engineering, and computational biology, just to pick out a few.\n\nThen one logic/language course, which again dips into theory, but I assume involves covering broadly useful constructs like recursive descent parsers, parse trees, code generation, etc.\n\nThen one systems elective - possibilities include operating systems, database systems, networking, compiler implementation, etc. They also list out the mathematical prerequisites which are totally uncontroversial (calculus, linear algebra, probability).\n\nThis smacks of a physics student going: \"Why am I taking all this calculus if I just want to do physics?\" I think it's comical how students expect a CS major to play out like a webdev bootcamp.

I can tell you as someone who sits on a committee reviewing applications for a significant scholarship organization as well as someone who attended a so-called \"prestige\" university, when we see a high schooler list publication as an EC, we tend to take it with a very, very large grain of salt. I have had to drill down on multiple publishing claims over the past few years. Published research has become a much more prevalent EC activity. When we discover that a student has exaggerated their contribution or even the existence of their name on a paper, it tarnishes the application. I have even picked up the phone to inquire about a few research papers because we are often confused about how something was achieved in a particular journal. We note how long a candidate worked in a particular lab or with a particular professor. The answers often lead to red flags about integrity. In academia, the AOs are not oblivious to selectivity and rigor among journals. Application reviewers know what it takes to produce ground-breaking research, and we know which journals are the legitimate ones that target high school-level research (e.g., The Journal of Emerging Investigators or Journal of Student Research). We are also aware that there are a large number of pay-to-play journals that have cropped up over the years, and those are a red flag. It is a bit like wack-a-mole, but we keep a list. Finally, when a personal essay is average or subpar, but an applicant states they have published research, it is a red flag that they may have used a paid research \"mentor.\"  All of this is to say, that no one is expecting you to publish peer-reviewed scholarly research as a high schooler.

So if you have a interview that you feel was bad or you feel you didn't do enough, I wouldn't really stress over it as the interview wouldn't bring that much of a negative impact. But if it seems that the interview has done well, then it can help you in admissions.\n\nThat being said, I know that the MIT interview was quite casual. Like not too casual in the way you speak with your family or friends but it's not really something extremely professional where they're going to judge you for the way you speak in the interview. My recommendation is think of this more as a casual conversation with a professional person and don't really overstress over it. What's important is really to give your answers to their questions and give a good reasoning for what they ask as well as asking them questions and to get to know more about the school(as long as it's not easily found on...say their website). Practice interviewing when the time comes because practice does make things perfect. Practice with someone so you could be more prepared.

My Princeton interview was the best for sure - met this dude while he was visiting back home and had a great discussion about our passions and what resources Princeton has to offer (now attending!).\n\nThere are a bunch of great websites online with decent interview questions that you can prepare with.

We are almost entirely evaluated on research and unfortunately it\u2019s teaching that alway gets the short end. If you go to a smaller university that focuses on teaching I can almost guarantee you that your classroom experience will be much much better. \n\nResources: this is the big and maybe only real difference. We have so much more money per student. We basically throw research opportunities and internships at whomever wants it. At my UC I had to fight pretty hard against probably dozens or maybe hundreds of others to get a RA. We have startup funds and research grants for students that really aren\u2019t all that hard to get. At a large public you will be fighting with other top kids for a few spots. You can make it happen for sure. There are usually enough RAs for example for those that want it, but you have to do the work to find it and you might not get one in the exact area you want. At a prestigious school it\u2019s more likely that you just have multiple options available. A SLAC probably doesn\u2019t even have the facilities at all.

Here is the full version:**\n\nIt sounds like a no-brainer to maximize a high-school senior\u2019s chances to get into college by picking one college to apply to early decision, which in most cases is binding.\n\nThe pressure to commit is enormous all across the board, from small state schools to the most selective of the Ivy League. But this year, the federal financial-aid process has shifted to a December start date that is still to be announced, and might actually spill over in January. Early applications are generally due Nov. 1 or Nov. 15, with decisions out in mid-December. \n\nThe CSS Profile, a much more intensive financial-aid form used by more than 200 of the top private universities, is set to officially open at its usual time on Oct. 1, according to Sara Sympson, director of communications for the College Board, which administers the form. (You may already be able to access the link on the CSS Profile website.) However, the colleges that use that form can\u2019t finalize aid packages until families complete the federal form, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), in order to include loans and subsidized grants.  \n\nThere\u2019s potentially an $80,000-a-year price tag on the line for tuition and room and board. \n\n\u201cA lot of things are unknown. The class entering in 2024 is kind of a guinea pig. It\u2019ll be a kerfuffle,\u201d said Joe Messinger, co-founder and director of college planning at Capstone Wealth Partners and co-founder and strategic adviser at College Aid Pro. \n\nAs a financial planner and the parent of a high-school senior, I worry this seems like exactly the wrong way to make a huge financial decision.

Here\u2019s what college financial-aid experts say you can do to avoid stepping into an unknown \u2014 and very expensive \u2014 abyss with early applications this year: \n\nJust skip it\nGary Carpenter\u2019s advice to clients of his financial-aid consulting business is simply to not apply to any early-decision school that requires a binding decision. But this advice is hard to hear for many families, who want their best shot at admission, damn the price. \n\nThe early scramble isn\u2019t just for the Ivy League or other selective schools; it may actually be more intense at schools that are using early admission as a marketing tool and trying to bolster their classes with early admits. Many financial experts agree on that point.\n\u201cThey have to compete,\u201d Messinger said. \u201cThink about a school like Denison University in Ohio, which leans on early decision heavily. Last year that was 50% of their class.\u201d\n\nYou could look instead for schools that offer early action, which is similar to early decision but not binding. It\u2019s offered less frequently but is growing in popularity, said Ross Riskin, a certified college financial consultant and chief learning officer at the Investments and Wealth Institute, a nonprofit certification body.", "ups": 3, "depth": 1, "author": "Mr-Macrophage", "replies": [{"selftext": "That way, you can get in early but still apply to other places and decide by the regular May 1 deadline. \u201cYou have more time to plan, and you can go back to the school to try to get a better offer,\u201d Riskin said. \n\nSome schools, like Loyola Marymount University in California, have a binding early-decision application and a nonbinding early-action one, both due Nov. 1. A second binding early-decision round is due Jan. 8, 2024, and the regular-decision date is Jan. 15. \u201cI tell families, why go crazy?\u201d Carpenter said.\n\nAnother early option is called restrictive early action, which isn\u2019t binding, but requires you to not apply early to any other school. Harvard and Yale Universities are among the schools that offer this option. \n\n\u201cApplicants for early decision often don\u2019t prioritize being able to compare financial-aid packages between colleges [and] universities as much as they value acceptance to a specific college or university,\u201d said Jonathon Ferguson, a CCFC based in Madison, Wis. \u201cThese feelings may be more pronounced this year due to the extended wait to submit the FAFSA, simply because it\u2019s hard for many families to not be able to take actions and need to wait.\u201d\n\nGame it out\nEvery college is required to have a net-price calculator to help families figure out ahead of time how much they will be charged, so theoretically, you should be able to get a good sense of what a college will cost you. But these often aren\u2019t accurate, said Carpenter, who is also executive director of the National College Affordability Group. They\u2019ll be even less so this year, because the FAFSA is changing to a simplified form with several new rules.", "ups": 2, "depth": 2, "author": "Mr-Macrophage", "replies": [{"selftext": "There\u2019s one clue as to how good a school\u2019s calculator is: How many questions does it ask? \u201cIf it\u2019s three or four, it\u2019s not accurate,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cIf it asks 40, it\u2019ll be closer.\u201d\n\nBut none of the calculators will tell you about merit aid or other scholarships. And the FAFSA will just give you a number, now called the student-aid index, that gives a sense of what the government thinks you can afford and how much the student qualifies for in federal loans and grants. It won\u2019t tell you the final price of the school, and that could be wildly misleading. \n\nIf you\u2019re willing to pay, you can hire an adviser or access online software. Messinger\u2019s College Aid Pro has a limited free version or a $149 yearly starter subscription, which can help you run an analysis of what your likely costs will be. \n\nHowever, this strategy only works if you have the information available to put into the calculator. You\u2019ll need to have it ready to go when the financial-aid forms finally open, so it\u2019s good to get it going. But you can run into trouble if you don\u2019t have access to what you need, like in the case of a divorced family that doesn\u2019t share financial information. And still, you can\u2019t account for how much a school is willing to discount its price for your extraordinary child. \n\nApply early and ignore the rules\nThe last option is to let your high-school senior throw their hat in the ring for the school they want and thwart the binding early-decision agreement by continuing to apply to other schools to see if you get a better financial-aid package. If the early-decision school accepts your child and the aid package does not work for you, then the contracts have some language that allows you to explore your other options. So technically, there shouldn\u2019t be repercussions, but urban legends live large. \n\n\u201cThe schools can\u2019t actually hold your feet to the fire if you can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Messinger said. \u201cSome try to use it as a leverage tool, but they can\u2019t make you come.\u201d\n\nMessinger said he\u2019s heard a lot of parents say getting in early is like winning the lottery, but it\u2019s really like a backwards lottery, because you\u2019re paying them for your prize. Applying early and also keeping in all your regular applications to sort out later is also a little backward. The best advice is to figure out what you can afford to pay for college, and apply only to schools where you can be sure you can afford it.\n\n\u201cIt should be financial first,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cBut this year, nobody knows what\u2019s going on and that\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating.", "ups": 3, "depth": 3, "author": "Mr-Macrophage", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}

One-half year of U.S. history and one-half year of civics or American government is also acceptable.\n\nEnglish (Area B)\nFour years of English are required and FIVE years are recommended. Five years can be achieved by taking two eligible classes during one academic year or taking a college course. Eligible classes include courses in language, composition and literature; they must integrate extensive reading, frequent writing, and practice listening and speaking with different audiences. Students may only use one year of ESL/ELD English.\n\nMathematics (Area C)\nThree years of mathematics are required and FIVE years are recommended.\n\nAlgebra\nTwo years are required. This includes both Algebra 1 and Algebra 2. Cal Poly will give consideration for coursework taken in seventh and/or eighth grade.\n\nGeometry\nOne year is required. This will include two-and-three dimensional geometry. Cal Poly will give consideration for coursework taken in seventh or eighth grade.\n\nAdvanced Math\nAlthough not a requirement for the CSU, Cal Poly recommends applicants complete two years of advanced math courses such as trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus or statistics for greater chances of admission.\n\nLab Science (Area D)\nTwo years of laboratory science are required, including one year of physical science and one year of biological science. FOUR years are recommended. Classes must provide fundamental knowledge in two of the following: biology, chemistry, or physics. A yearlong interdisciplinary, or integrated, or earth and space science course can meet one year of this requirement.\n\nLanguage Other than English (Area E)\nTwo years of the same language, other than English, are required and FOUR years are recommended. American Sign Language is acceptable. Cal Poly will give consideration for coursework taken in seventh and/or eighth grade.\n\nVisual/Performing Arts (Area F)\nOne year is required and TWO years are recommended. Courses can be chosen from one of the following categories: dance, music, theater, interdisciplinary arts, or visual arts (e.g., painting, web/graphic design, film/video, inter/multimedia arts). Two one-semester courses from the same discipline is also acceptable.\n\nElectives (Area G)\nOne year is required. Electives can be taken any year but must fall within the following subject areas: Visual and Performing Arts, History, Social Science, English, Advanced Mathematics, Science and languages other than English.\n\nSeventh and/or Eighth Grade Coursework (if applicable)\nCal Poly accepts coursework taken in seventh and/or eighth grade for Mathematics and Language Other Than English (LOTE) on the application.

Yes, this subreddit is completely unrepresentative of the average high school/transfer student. Yes, T20s get disproportionate attention here. But is that surprising to anyone? The type of person who is attracted to a subreddit like r/ApplyingToCollege is not your average student. Students who don't think much about college and don't care much about what college they get into aren't going to use a subreddit like this. You might read about other's insane accomplishments here and feel like you haven't achieved as much, but that is HEALTHY. It gives you two choices: one, it motivates you to improve (and provides inspiration for things you can do), or two, it helps you realize that the immense effort to get into a top university isn't worth it (and that's a totally respectable decision!) r/ApplyingToCollege gives you a realistic assessment of the competition you are up against if you want to get into a top university. It also has an incredible wealth of knowledge and people who volunteer their free time (shoutout to u/prsehgal) to help you achieve your goals.\n\nA2C is also not as prestige obsessed as everyone swears it is; when I was debating between going to a T10 and UCLA with in-state tuition, everyone pushed me towards UCLA where I am now an incoming transfer because people recognized saving $$$ was very important. That said, yes, people do care a lot about prestige here. There's nothing wrong with chasing after a top university. Wanting to get into a T20-30 is a great goal; being surrounded by smart, ambitious people will shape you positively as a person and give you a great network when you graduate. (Not saying you can't do this outside of top universities, just that they are great environments for this). And again, a subreddit like this is going to attract more people that want to get into T20-30s than people who are indifferent to rankings. However, it is HARD to get admitted, and the tough pills to swallow here are not \"toxic\", they are reality. This is a trend on subreddits for competitive things; everyone on r/csmajors complains about the toxicity and unrealistic expectations for getting a FAANG internship/new grad offer, but by and large, the advice there is excellent if that is your goal (even if it's a tough pill to swallow).

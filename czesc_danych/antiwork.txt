You are in direct violation of Massachusetts child labor laws. You have broke several of them during my daughter's employment, and now due to her retaliatory termination these facts have come to my attention. You employed my daughter without a working permit - illegal. You had my 15 year old daughter working past 9pm before labor day - illegal. You had my daughter working past 7pm after labor day - illegal. You terminated my daughters employment because she could not work past 7pm after labor day - illegal ( this is called a retaliatory termination and is absolutely in violation of Massachusetts state labor laws).  Taking part of the tips from the girls serving people at the window without serving anyone yourself - tip theft - illegal.\n\nNot only did you wrongfully and illegally terminate her employment but you decided to try and humiliate and berate a teenage girl. Allow me to tell you that YOU as a manager and employer should be more knowledgeable on labor laws that you are violating. It is not and never was my daughters responsibility to find coverage for any shifts you were scheduling her to ILLEGALY work. \nPlease send her paycheck to our residence at your earliest convenience. If you do not, you will be in violation of yet another Massachusetts state and child labor law - withholding of wages - illegal.\nI have not yet decided whether to formally file a complaint with the Massachusetts department of labor, and with [redacted] corperate human resources. I strongly advise you to educate yourself on the laws under which you must abide by if you continue to have a management position because you have opened up your employer to several legal issues.  Again I have not decided whether to formally bring these charges against you, I will be expecting my childs paycheck to be sent out promptly. \n\n\nPs I have attached the Massachusetts state child labor laws so you can become aware of the laws which you have broken.\n\nhttps://www.mass.gov/info-details/work-hours-restrictions-for-minors\n\nhttps://www.mass.gov/info-details/protections-against-retaliation\n\nhttps://www.mass.gov/info-details/workers-right-to-sue\n\n\nLet me know if this looks OK or what you think I should do.

They posted a range of $15-18/hour. The actual range for that office position is $26-32/hr. I went into the interview with that in mind and listened to the interviewer tell me the other benefits of the position: company car when traveling outside of a 50 mile radius to visit other locations and a hotel if the drive to a location is over 4 hours.\n\nI'm thinking, \"That's nice but I'm already being paid the same wage range right now.. Yes I want an office position, but not unless I can get close the bottom of the pay bracket.\"\n\nThey've seen what I can do with paperwork. I made all of the files for this little branch of the company look perfect for the audit we had a month ago. They know I can make things better for the larger company and wanted to give me the chance to get the position by interviewing for it.\n\nWhen I told the guy interviewing me the pay range for the position in our local area, his jaw almost literally dropped. He was speechless for about a minute. Afterwards we went on how the behavior professionals with Bachelors and Masters didn't make that much. (We work with clients with disabilities)\n\nI have been screwed over before by not standing my ground when it comes to pay, this time I'm standing my ground. It may cost me a nicer office job, but I want at least 24-26 to start.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the support! I will tell them I'm worth the $30/hr. As long as I get in the 26-32 range I'll be happy.

She told me they'd found the reservation clue and everyone was down to play because (A) it made the day go by a little faster and (B) they thought it was a fun way to say goodbye.

I work as a biomedical technician for a small hospital. We are a small team, 2 techs and one manager. When I started to work at the hospital my manager would constantly always tell me that when he retires ill be the one taking his place (the other tech is a 70 year old man who's ready to retire to ). So ever since then I busted my ass to learn a lot more than what I already knew and kept the place running smoothly and pretty much tackled everything that has ever been thrown at me for two years now. I know the hospital in and out and know pretty much how to do my managers job as well since I've been doing alot of his work such as writing reports, calling vendors, handling projects, getting quotes, contracts, etc.... Recently the day came and he finally retired and left me whatever leftover task he had pending. When that happened we had gotten a new director which is in charge of biomed and three other departments, this new director approach me and asked me to take charge and manage the department while they \" post my managers position\" I was shocked as this new director prior to approaching me would constantly say I've been doing an excellent job in running department and keeping the hospital going with serviced equipment. As I composed my self from what he said I responded with \" what do you mean post the position? I thought I was getting promoted since I've been pretty much running the department without manager pay \" he responded with \" its just protocol, apply for the position and ill interview you \" at this point I was still in shock I felt a massive blow. A couple of days pass and my dumbass applies for the position when it goes up and we only get three applicants including me after about a week. He then calls me into the office for an \" interview \" .... OMFG he starts telling me \" Alright I'm going to ask you a couple of questions about your self and about your accomplishments \" and I say okay and I start answering everything he asks me. He  then concludes that the interview went short since he doesn't have anything else to ask because he DOESN'T KNOW ANY THING about my department.. Exact words ( \" I don't know anything about biomed but it was assigned to me so I took it \" ).... I left speechless and with a blank face... Couple of more days pass and I come to find out from someone else that he chose another candidate for the managers position because he felt I wasn't \" confident \" enough and here l was still doing all the managers duties.....

(But it does seem to be given as a reason to \"punish\" the company/organization.  That and \"do as little as possible.\")\n\nLet's start with your expectations.  They were wrong.  Your manager made a mistake when he said \"when I retire you'll be the one taking my place.\"  That was not HIS decision to make.  It never was.  The best he could do would be to RECOMMEND to the director that you take over his position.\n\nPosting the position.  Never be surprised by this.  It is something that will be done in almost any company/organization.\n\nI don't think you made a mistake by \"going the extra mile.\"  You learned a lot that will help you going forward and you gained valuable leadership experience.\n\nIs moving into a management position important to you?  \"Yes\" is a good answer.  And if it is then you should probably look for a new job because a management position where you are isn't going to be open for a while.\n\nBut if the answer is \"Not really\" then try to let go of the disappointment.  Let other things determine if this is where you want to stay.  Are you happy with your pay?  Do you like your job?  Do you like your co-workers?  How are your benefits?  If everything else is ok then give your new manager a chance.  He/she might turn out to be awesome.  And, if not, maybe it's time to look elsewhere.\n\nBut I think you should go to the director and have a conversation.  \"I've been running the department for a while (it wasn't clear in your post how long).  Is it performing well?\"  Make him explain to you why you weren't chosen.  But also point out to him that you have been competent in the role.

My manager was moving on and she wanted me to take over the department.  It wasn't her decision but she gave her recommendation to the director and VPs.

Here's a quick personal anectodote that might make you feel a bit better: \n\nI worked for about a decade with a somewhat old school, classically business trained guy. Good guy, but a bit misguided. He once told me a long winded story (he was the owner of a small shop, and I was the only employee) to try and inspire \"better work ethic.\" He told me about how he work at corporation x in department y. There was a position above his that he really wanted, so he did essentially exactly what you did, learned everything above his station and did the work of the position he wanted. \n\nHe did this for 6 years while his boss repeatedly told him \"good job, ur awesome, hang in there, soon.\" He was proud to be they guy they called in for overtime all the time, the guy solving all the problems, etc. So after 6 years of this they did promote him. He then ended the story saying \"of course, 7 months later the company merged with a chinese corp that immediately dismantled it and sold it off for liquidation... But still, I got my promotion, hard work will always get you farther!\" \n\nI raised an eyebrow, knowing a little about how corporate positions tend to work. I asked him a few prudent follow up questions, and he ultimately revealed that as the primary method of bonuses (or basically instead of having a 401k) the company handed out stock options to the employees. Turns out that as part of the buyout process, all shares were locked on wall street, no buying, no selling, for something like the first 6 months after. The liquidation by the chinese tanked the stock value of the company (the suits having sold all shares before they sold the company of course). By the time he could sell, the shares were worth pennies, and shortly after the company was completely dissolved by the chinese, leaving him with no job. \n\nI looked this man dead in the eye and said \"so you willingly spent 6 years working a tough job for about half the salary you should have been paid while listening to lip service from your boss... In exchange for a small, brief pay bonus before losing your job entirely alongside a huge portion of what was essentially your retirement savings...\" He turned red and start shouting \"you missed the while point of the story!\"\n\nAll I could do was roll my eyes.

I'm on the verge of a breakdown, my mental health is really suffering. I have worked in this job for 10 months but I don't even want to go back for another day.

PLUS, \\*\\*everyone\\*\\* is always coming to me for help with everything because they know that with my autism I find it impossible to say no.

Conditions don't put themselves on hold, and this applies both to acute and long term conditions.\n\n\\- Patients who need care are often in pain, which is suffering, which is not supposed to be produced by, or ignored by, the medical profession (that it often is, is part of the problem and I daresay a large reason for nurses getting chewed out by patients).\n\n\\- Medical professionals have a duty of care and take on responsibility for a patient once the patient is in their care.  Abdication of this reponsibility is their problem to solve, not the patient's.\n\n\\- It is mathematically unjustified to assume that a patient is receiving the best care possible.  That only happens at Mayo, Johns Hopkins, and the like.  Statistically, the patient is likely to be receiving average or sub-standard care (the best care facilities skew the average, since the worst ones can be shut down and so that end of the curve is truncated, whereas the best facilities are not shut down).\n\n\\- Insurance will not just willy-nilly keep approving more and more doctor visits, more and more repeat procedures.  Patients are not able to retract permission for billing from a subpar medical provider.  Therefore, once a patient is receiving care, they are quite likely blocked out from going elsewhere for that same care for a while.\n\n\\- Scheduling challenges mean that a patient might wait months or years for a replacement appointment, even at the same institution to say nothing of switching institutions.  And, prospective patients are not able to vet a doctor's abilities beforehand; the answer to questions is usually \"you can discuss that with the Dr at your appointment\".  See the first item, above.\n\n\\- Asking for \"another nurse\" in the same institution might, but is not likely to, improve the situation.  Attitude problems are often institutional.  Good training and good attitudes are often institutional.  The two don't often overlap. \n\nIt is no surprise to me that patients, faced with tiktok nurses who are quiet quitting and full of contempt for the patients they've barely studied about, resort to trying to assert themselves over nurses.  Nurses, NPs, and PAs much more frequently than not: don't write down symptoms, miswrite them, don't respond to requests for pain control, are rough with patients, don't know how to perform clinical exams with thoroughness and attention to detail (which capability any patient who's been through a few doctors quickly learns to identify), don't know how to perform the complete clinical exam that's needed for a diagnosis but rather just run through a couple high points and bill for the whole thing, misuse statistics to put a patient into a bucket where their symptoms don't have to be dealt with (\"oh you have a blown out disc and full body nerve pain after your car accident? well it also can happen to people when they get older so probably it's you being older than me, bye\"), don't communicate important messages to Drs such as \"I'm allergic to that\", and so on.  \n\nCheck [this out](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/scope-practice/why-stopping-scope-creep-about-protecting-patients) for a discussion of NPs diagnostic limitations, and consider that nurses are even less authorized to make decisions, but often, through a combination of their position and their arrogance, end up standing in the way of patient needs and patient communications with their doctors, often with bad results.\n\n*Don't* assume people are getting the best care.

{"post": {"title": "This is a theory only, but\u2026", "subreddit": "antiwork", "selftext": "So, the United States has a history of red-lining and block-busting that ensured pockets of poverty along with pockets of great wealth. We pay taxes based on the geographic area, and how much our property is worth. The taxes pay for the public schools in the area, and this results in great variance in quality of education from one area compared to others. If the area collects lots of taxes, lots of money goes to the schools, the quality of education goes up. There are other factors, such as the population having discretionary income to expose their children to desired experiences such as museums, vacations, extracurricular activities like horse back riding and painting. This also works the opposite way.\n\nThere are geographic areas that are undesirable, and sell at prices much lower than other, wealthier areas. These areas usually contain pollutants, industrial business, noise pollution, or other less-desirable living environments.  The housing appraised at lower levels than the wealthier areas, so fewer tax dollars flow to the surrounding schools. This results in lower equality of education, and less exposure to desired experiences. The experiences in these lower quality areas usually have crime, negative aesthetics, and illness due to the environment. There becomes a poverty that tends to be generational in nature. \n\nUsually, the most direct path to maintain class is to have access to the institutions mostly held in wealthier areas.  Lower income populations have one main bar to entry: affording the housing in an area with good schools, low crime, green spaces, and generally better living conditions. But what happens if those arbitrary boundaries no longer exist?\n\nEnter work-from-home. A person can now live in a depressed area, and can earn more than what normally pays in the areas surrounding lower median-income communities. Now, private schools become affordable, and desirable experiences can be had where normally there are only undesirable experiences.  Soon enough, that person can afford to move to an area with a better overall environment. That person can quickly get out of poverty in years as opposed to decades. \n\nNow, all that redlining and block-busting does not have the same result - poverty can no longer be corralled for generations.  There is no longer an institutional segregation that holds back large swaths of our population. Think there are some really scared racists/classists out there?

{"post": {"title": "Some simple stats about our stock and a bit of tinfoil that we own the free float.", "subreddit": "amcstock", "selftext": "I've been seeing some huge smooth brains running amok and unable to do some simple mathematics while saying \"we all need only 8.5 shares average to hold the float not held by institutions\". Simply put we need a little more than that and I believe its another tactic to make people sell to \"Recuperate their initial investment\" when the price reaches the low 100-150s. If everyone believes that holding the float is just 8.5 shares and we all keep that amount in our portfolio after selling it'll still go to astronomical heights then you're delusional. So, here's what we can do to reach the real numbers and what every shareholder has in their portfolio in order to hold the entire float.\n\nScenario 1: Hold the float with all shareholders.\n\nSo we were told there are 4 million shareholders. I'm a little more conservative than that and assume they mean 4 million people who registered as a shareholder. I assume there are about half a million crypto bros who just wanted the NFTs and about half a million paper hands just to make it a very conservative estimate of 3 million actual shareholders. So together with institutions (Who hold a reported 41.34m shares) 3 million shareholders would need to hold an average of 52.24 shares which would have an investment value currently at a measly 400 dollars at time of writing. If we take away the institutional holders we get to a manageable 66.02 shares (509 dollars) each to hold the entire float. \n\nI'm about 75-80% certain that this is absolutely the case but lets make it more conservative to up the probability that we own the float and to show what we need to keep in order to hold the float indefinitely and to watch wallstreet crumble under their own toxicity.\n\nScenario 2: Holding the float with numbers from this sub.\n\nSo we know there are 515k members of this sub, some more active than others but I think many are just waiting for MOASS. Conservatively speaking we can assume that there are 515k apes out there. With the new float of just 198m shares we can deduce that this sub needs 384 shares each (a small 3k at current prices) to hold the entire float. There are quite a few whales with about 20x that in this sub so if a few people are a bit shy then it still works. This theory has a bit of \"Je ne sais quoi\" but it makes my titties tingle and I'm about 90% certain that this is really whats going on.\n\nScenario 3: Holding the float with active members\n\nSo we have a certain number of people who frequent the sub and a certain point where there are about 50k active members online. Some very quick math makes it about 4000 shares (31000 dollars) each to hold the float with just the active members of the sub. Is this likely? Not very but its a cool theory. I give this about a 5% chance of being the case but who knows, we may be surprised when this house of cards falls. (Small post note which I thought of, many people stopped using Reddit regularly since the API situation so the number of active members doesn't reflect the actual number of people)\n\nThe \"whale\" theory: \n\nSo how many whales does it take to hold a float? I see a whale as someone who has over 10x the average needed from the total 3m shareholders including institutional holders. So that would include everyone that has over 523 shares. So we take that conservative number and come down to a measly 340k people. 340k small whales. Less people than that populate this sub. A smaller number of people than the population of Honolulu. And definitely less people than the number of people who own over 523 shares.\n\ntl;dr Market is fraudulent and we own the float with a bit of math and not being stupid and saying we only need 8.5 shares because that is a lie.", "ups": 176, "permalink": "/r/amcstock/comments/16rmje8/some_simple_stats_about_our_stock_and_a_bit_of/", "num_comments": 60}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Wow by your math I'm a whale.

{"post": {"title": "SEC Charges Citadel Securities for Violating Order Marking Requirements of Short Sale Regulations", "subreddit": "amcstock", "selftext": "Washington D.C., Sept. 22, 2023 \u2014\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against broker-dealer Citadel Securities LLC for violating a provision of Regulation SHO, the regulatory framework designed to address abusive short selling practices, which requires broker-dealers to mark sale orders as long, short, or short exempt. These records are routinely used by regulators in policing prohibited short selling activity. To settle the SEC\u2019s charges, Miami-based Citadel Securities agreed to pay a $7 million penalty.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s order, for a five-year period, it is estimated that Citadel Securities incorrectly marked millions of orders, inaccurately denoting that certain short sales were long sales and vice versa. The SEC\u2019s order finds that the inaccurate marks resulted from a coding error in Citadel Securities\u2019s automated trading system and that the firm provided the inaccurate data to regulators, including the SEC during this period.\n\n\u201cCompliance with the order marking requirements of Reg SHO is a key component of regulatory efforts to curtail abusive market practices, including \u2018naked\u2019 short selling,\u201d said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. \u201cThis action against Citadel Securities demonstrates that a broker-dealer\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of Reg SHO can have negative downstream consequences on the accuracy of the firm\u2019s electronic records, including its electronic blue sheet reporting, depriving the Commission of important information about the markets it regulates.\u201d\n\nThe order charges Citadel Securities with violating Rule 200(g) of Reg SHO. Without admitting or denying the findings, Citadel Securities consented to a cease-and-desist order imposing a censure, a $7 million penalty, and a set of undertakings, including a written certification that the coding error has been remediated and a review of the firm\u2019s computer programming and coding logic involved in processing relevant transactions.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Seth M. Nadler of the SEC\u2019s Home Office. Christopher Ray of the SEC\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets; Elcin Yildirim, Alan Lenarcic, and Peter Csatorday of the SEC\u2019s Division of Examinations; Mandy Sturmfelz of the SEC\u2019s Market Abuse Unit; Damon Taaffe and Melissa Armstrong of the Home Office Trial Unit; and Kevin Gershfeld and Robert Nesbitt of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics provided assistance. The investigation was supervised by Mr. Cave.", "ups": 649, "permalink": "/r/amcstock/comments/16pbdrk/sec_charges_citadel_securities_for_violating/", "num_comments": 101}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Ahh, finally, the slap on the wrist we were all waiting for.", "ups": 192, "depth": 0, "author": "Cabbusses", "replies": [{"selftext": "Cost of doing business", "ups": 69, "depth": 1, "author": "beezy_87", "replies": [{"selftext": "SEC hush money bribe", "ups": 20, "depth": 2, "author": "1villageidiot", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "![gif](giphy|3oriffhhxhmuQP2Xgk|downsized)", "ups": 42, "depth": 1, "author": "INTJ-ADHD", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Any senators get on this?", "ups": 4, "depth": 1, "author": "Certain-Hat5152", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "More like pinky finger", "ups": 2, "depth": 1, "author": "Nervous-Bullfrog-884", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "Punishable by a fine means Allowable for a price.", "ups": 128, "depth": 0, "author": "GTTrush", "replies": [{"selftext": "Exactly, the fines are already accounted for within their margins.\n\nBtw, dokt you guys in usa have some kind of frequent flyer penalty?\n\nWhen I get busted for coke or weed or whatever I get highest penalty?\nOr does that only apply when poor?", "ups": 35, "depth": 1, "author": "d4ve3000", "replies": [{"selftext": "Sorry only for the poor.", "ups": 19, "depth": 2, "author": "Livinsfloridalife", "replies": [{"selftext": "![gif](giphy|f8lDluiWJ7yQTtdS3L|downsized)", "ups": 5, "depth": 3, "author": "INTJ-ADHD", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "Poor go to jail.

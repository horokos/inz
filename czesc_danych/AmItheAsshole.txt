It was annoying as a teen because I'd go with my parents and was kind of stuck there. But now, I will just leave when I please. I'll pop out and get something, come back or just leave and go home whenever I want.  I don't mind watching kids but I hate them being dumped on me and it just being expected(I've told them this). They've gotten upset that I can just up and leave when I want and do it. I'll just say \"going out, be back in like 30 minutes\" and walk out. Or i'll just simply say \"I'm not watching kids\" but they'll still leave them around me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of weeks ago it my grandmother's birthday. She always has everyone come over and it is usually a fun time. I like my family and like seeing my grandma. Shortly before her birthday I was skiing with friends, fell weird, and broke my foot. Not a big deal. I just wear a cast and can't really run around or move much. To note, I was walking on crutches while visiting my grandmother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo even before I arrive I get texts like \"when will you be coming?\" \"are you on your way?\" I showed up and when I walked in the house on crutches, majority of my family was like \"what happened?\" and asking if I was okay. But a few of them rolled their eyes and got upset that I couldn't watch kids. I saw them angrily put wine away and get upset that they couldn't get tipsy/drunk. A couple of people had to work and couldn't come but they dropped off their kids and they were trying to say. \"Now we'll have to call (X) at work and tell them to pick up their kids.\" I told them I didn't plan to break my foot and that I told them before that they shouldn't count on me for that. They said \"you could have warned us.\" I said \"I warned you when I said a while ago and repeatedly to not count on me for that.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey think I was being an asshole but I don't think that at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She had been sick for a really long time. I (17m) was close to her because she and my dad were very close when he was a kid and she was the grandma who helped take care of the grandkids while the parents worked. My dad always said she was the greatest person. He died when I was 8 and our relationship was extra special after his loss.\n\nMy parents were separated when my dad died and mom had sort of moved on already. Two years later she moved in her now husband and my stepsister who is 5 years younger than me.\n\nMy paternal family never invited my stepsister along to things and only some have met her in passing. My great grandma never met or spoke to her and there was zero relationship between them. \n\nWhen great grandma died she left all the family something. I got my great grandpa's watch that she had some work done on to make it work and look a bit more modern for today. Of course this was done before she died. The watch had her and great grandpa's initials and he wore it every day until his death. I also got some photos of hers and a blanket she had made for my dad that everyone agreed I should have.\n\nMy stepsister asked a few days after I got the stuff why she never got anything. My mom and her dad were like I'm sure there are some things. Mom even called my grandma to ask about something for my stepsister and grandma told her only family were left or entitled to great grandma's things.\n\nMy mom was trying to tell my stepsister that she should have gotten something and they would figure it out. My stepsister asked me and suggested we share the photos and blanket. I told her no and said she didn't get anything from great grandma because they never met or had any relationship. I told her she was my dad's grandma, not my mom's, and they were not family.\n\nMy stepsister was still upset and started to cry. She asked why I have a whole other family that she doesn't and why don't they want to include her. She is autistic and doesn't always understand social things. She's also had an interest in being around my paternal family in the past.\n\nMy mom told me it was disgusting to say those things to her and I should be ashamed for upsetting her and making her feel unworthy. She also told me she was ashamed of how flippant I was about my \"little sister\" being left out.\n\nAITA?", "ups": 2531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q1lh5/aita_for_telling_my_stepsister_she_didnt_get/", "num_comments": 439}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She had been sick for a really long time. I (17m) was close to her because she and my dad were very close when he was a kid and she was the grandma who helped take care of the grandkids while the parents worked. My dad always said she was the greatest person. He died when I was 8 and our relationship was extra special after his loss.\n\nMy parents were separated when my dad died and mom had sort of moved on already. Two years later she moved in her now husband and my stepsister who is 5 years younger than me.\n\nMy paternal family never invited my stepsister along to things and only some have met her in passing. My great grandma never met or spoke to her and there was zero relationship between them. \n\nWhen great grandma died she left all the family something. I got my great grandpa's watch that she had some work done on to make it work and look a bit more modern for today. Of course this was done before she died. The watch had her and great grandpa's initials and he wore it every day until his death. I also got some photos of hers and a blanket she had made for my dad that everyone agreed I should have.\n\nMy stepsister asked a few days after I got the stuff why she never got anything. My mom and her dad were like I'm sure there are some things. Mom even called my grandma to ask about something for my stepsister and grandma told her only family were left or entitled to great grandma's things.\n\nMy mom was trying to tell my stepsister that she should have gotten something and they would figure it out. My stepsister asked me and suggested we share the photos and blanket. I told her no and said she didn't get anything from great grandma because they never met or had any relationship. I told her she was my dad's grandma, not my mom's, and they were not family.\n\nMy stepsister was still upset and started to cry. She asked why I have a whole other family that she doesn't and why don't they want to include her. She is autistic and doesn't always understand social things. She's also had an interest in being around my paternal family in the past.\n\nMy mom told me it was disgusting to say those things to her and I should be ashamed for upsetting her and making her feel unworthy. She also told me she was ashamed of how flippant I was about my \"little sister\" being left out.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Are they valid?

{"post": {"title": "AITA for my only demand to be not to take my baby out of the house even though I\u2019m getting free daycare?", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "selftext": "My husband &amp; I talked about daycare &amp; how our schedules would work since we both work full time. It was agreed that his parents would babysit mon-sat &amp; my parents would babysit Sundays, when needed. Of course his mom was thrilled to be the main care taker (she retired purposely for this). I ended up having a very complicated pregnancy where my daughter had to be born 3 months early. She was in the NICU for 6 months. I had to go back to work after 8 weeks &amp; saved the rest of my time for when she was discharged. It was rough to say the least.\n\nOnce she was discharged, all she kept talking about was how she couldn\u2019t wait to babysit &amp; that her \u201cplayroom\u201d was ready for her &amp; if I ever needed to run errands I could leave my daughter with her. But I\u2019m the type of parent who isn\u2019t bothered by bringing my baby anywhere unless it\u2019s prohibited / dangerous. This was me &amp; my husbands time as a family to bond together.\n\nTo make a long story short, my entire leave she would not stop harassing us to have a conversation about expectations when she\u2019s babysitting. If we\u2019re picky about diapers, a sleep schedule etc. I told him I felt like she\u2019s just rushing us back to work &amp; I didn\u2019t appreciate it. I told my husband I\u2019m honestly not that picky. I will provide her with everything she will need &amp; that she\u2019d only be watching her for 2-3 hrs a day anyway (we have opposite work schedules). My only main concerns were that I did not want her giving my daughter ANY medication (she\u2019s already on meds) &amp; that I don\u2019t want her driving her anywhere.\n\nSo this is where I\u2019m questioning AITA.. IMO, she\u2019s just too young to do anything or go anywhere (her adjusted age is 5 months old) &amp; something we both agree on is that my MIL is a horrible driver. Not that she\u2019s a reckless driver, but the opposite. She\u2019s such an overly cautious driver that she causes other cars to stop short or she gets honked at all the time &amp; cut off. She\u2019s the driver in the left hand lane going 45 MPH on the highway. We just honestly don\u2019t feel safe with her driving anywhere especially if it\u2019s not needed. She just wants to take her out to show her off &amp; have \u201cplay dates\u201d with the other family babies (I\u2019ve heard her trying to set up these playdates &amp; stopped her once telling her she won\u2019t be provided with a car seat) Well my husband ended up going to talk to her without me &amp; pretty much the conversation went sour. She did not like being told that she can\u2019t \u201cever leave the house\u201d he reminded her that she\u2019s only baby sitting for 2-3 hrs, 2-3x/week. He really fought for this, to the point where she said something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m providing you with free daycare, I\u2019ll take her where ever I want or you\u2019re going to have to find someone else.\u201d My MIL was so eager to babysit &amp; now wants to play this power card of \u201cI\u2019ll do what I want since I\u2019m not charging you\u201d attitude. \n\nAITA for my only demand to be not to take my baby out of the house even though I\u2019m getting free daycare?", "ups": 510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q8mo4/aita_for_my_only_demand_to_be_not_to_take_my_baby/", "num_comments": 347}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also I typically work in the morning and he works nights which is again why it would only be for 2-3 hrs. He leaves for work at 4p and I\u2019m typically home by 6p. \n2) My husband and I have had a conversation about emergencies. My in laws live next door to us and have access to our house. (Which is another boundary we are working on with her) So I explained to my husband that the car seat is available to her in emergencies. But if there was a TRUE massive emergency, she should be calling me and my pediatrician dispatches an ambulance. 3) I absolutely do not mind people going to her! I would prefer it. The play date she was trying to set up, she mentioned going to her house which is a 45 min drive.\n4) Major one I should have mentioned.. My FIL doesn\u2019t work. He is home 24/7 and absolutely respects all our our wishes. Unfortunately because he never worked, it\u2019s that type of relationship where whatever my MIL says goes.. we\u2019ve asked him separately that if she wants to take her anywhere, for HIM to drive but he knows he has no control over that decision. So she also wouldn\u2019t be \u201clocked up in the house\u201d because he can just watch her as she goes out. \n\nI will add I don\u2019t think my husband clarified that this is just while she\u2019s a baby.

It was agreed that his parents would babysit mon-sat &amp; my parents would babysit Sundays, when needed. Of course his mom was thrilled to be the main care taker (she retired purposely for this). I ended up having a very complicated pregnancy where my daughter had to be born 3 months early. She was in the NICU for 6 months. I had to go back to work after 8 weeks &amp; saved the rest of my time for when she was discharged. It was rough to say the least.\n\nOnce she was discharged, all she kept talking about was how she couldn\u2019t wait to babysit &amp; that her \u201cplayroom\u201d was ready for her &amp; if I ever needed to run errands I could leave my daughter with her. But I\u2019m the type of parent who isn\u2019t bothered by bringing my baby anywhere unless it\u2019s prohibited / dangerous. This was me &amp; my husbands time as a family to bond together.\n\nTo make a long story short, my entire leave she would not stop harassing us to have a conversation about expectations when she\u2019s babysitting. If we\u2019re picky about diapers, a sleep schedule etc. I told him I felt like she\u2019s just rushing us back to work &amp; I didn\u2019t appreciate it. I told my husband I\u2019m honestly not that picky. I will provide her with everything she will need &amp; that she\u2019d only be watching her for 2-3 hrs a day anyway (we have opposite work schedules). My only main concerns were that I did not want her giving my daughter ANY medication (she\u2019s already on meds) &amp; that I don\u2019t want her driving her anywhere.\n\nSo this is where I\u2019m questioning AITA.. IMO, she\u2019s just too young to do anything or go anywhere (her adjusted age is 5 months old) &amp; something we both agree on is that my MIL is a horrible driver. Not that she\u2019s a reckless driver, but the opposite. She\u2019s such an overly cautious driver that she causes other cars to stop short or she gets honked at all the time &amp; cut off. She\u2019s the driver in the left hand lane going 45 MPH on the highway. We just honestly don\u2019t feel safe with her driving anywhere especially if it\u2019s not needed. She just wants to take her out to show her off &amp; have \u201cplay dates\u201d with the other family babies (I\u2019ve heard her trying to set up these playdates &amp; stopped her once telling her she won\u2019t be provided with a car seat) Well my husband ended up going to talk to her without me &amp; pretty much the conversation went sour. She did not like being told that she can\u2019t \u201cever leave the house\u201d he reminded her that she\u2019s only baby sitting for 2-3 hrs, 2-3x/week. He really fought for this, to the point where she said something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m providing you with free daycare, I\u2019ll take her where ever I want or you\u2019re going to have to find someone else.\u201d My MIL was so eager to babysit &amp; now wants to play this power card of \u201cI\u2019ll do what I want since I\u2019m not charging you\u201d attitude. \n\nAITA for my only demand to be not to take my baby out of the house even though I\u2019m getting free daycare?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I came home from school yesterday in not the best mood, and my fianc\u00e9, \u201cJake\u201d (25M) immediately noticed I wasn\u2019t acting like myself. He asked me what happened and although I didn\u2019t really go into too much detail, I told him it was a rough day at work. Then Jake\u2019s brother, \u201cDaniel\u201d (31M), who is currently staying with us,  chimed into the conversation from across the room. He said that I didn\u2019t have a right to complain because teachers are glorified babysitters, and that if I had a \u201creal job\u201d maybe he\u2019d understand. \n\nNormally, I try to brush these comments off, and honestly at first, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was kidding, so I gave him the opportunity to repeat what he said, but he was serious. The second time, he added that \u201che didn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t want to do something \u201cmeaningful and productive\u201d with my life. At this point, Jake was getting pretty upset listening to this happen. He and Daniel have a very tumultuous relationship that they were recently working on, but he told Daniel that if he continues to speak to me that way he would have to leave our house. \n\nIt is also important to add here that Daniel works really long hours in a hospital, has a 2 year old daughter, and has commented previously about how he wishes he got to spend more time with her. In the moment with my frustration. I responded to Daniel\u2019s  comments by saying, \u201cat least I get to spend every holiday and summer with my family, that\u2019s what meaningful and productive to me.\u201d\n\nDaniel and stormed out, and shortly after I felt really bad about what I\u2019d said. I asked Jake if I should text Daniel and apologize or wait for him to come back and do it in person. Jake said that I\u2019m NTA, and that Daniel needs to be the first one to apologize to me. Jake even went as far as to say that if I did not receive an apology, Daniel would not be at our wedding, which I think might be a bit extreme. I can see both sides here. Daniel did start the argument, and enter a conversation that wasn\u2019t about him to begin with quite aggressively, but I\u2019m now unsure if my comments were out of line. AITA? Should I apologize to Daniel?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"post": {"title": "AITA for telling my husband he needs to spend more time with our sons and not his nephew?", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "selftext": "Me (45F) and my husband (46M) have two sons. The older one is 21 and in college and works a part time job on the side. The younger one is 16 and still in high-school.\n\nMy husband's brother has two sons as well who are 24 and 28. The older one is very nice and polite but the younger one (let's call him Simon) had always been problematic since I can remember. He's a very picky eater, refuses to even bother engaging in a conversation unless he's interested in it and would always be the one getting fussy if we go somewhere on a family gathering. He hardly ever addresses me and whenever he used to come over whether by himself or with his brother, he barely managed to greet me. If I ask him personal questions, he shuts me down easily. \n\n\nHowever he and my husband seem to have a good friendship and even talk on the phone once or twice a week.\n\nMy husband's brother works two jobs and  wasn't always a very present father. So Simon had attached himself to my husband even as a kid because of availability and common interests. When he was around 5, Simon even used to say he wants to marry my husband. We all saw it as a joke and moved past it but I found the attachment odd since then.\n\nHe and my husband both like guns, hunting, video games and the same types of music. Even cars too which is my husband's main hobby these days.\n\nA few months ago Simon wanted to go on a hunting trip with his father but got refused so my husband offered to take him instead. I told him he should take our sons too and Simon's brother so it would be like a family bonding experience. \n\nHe agreed but apparently it didn't go well. My older son and Simon's brother didn't like it and my younger son was on his phone the whole time and complained since the hunting grounds are further away and require a lot of walking. My husband told me this and said he wouldn't force anyone else to come if they didn't want to.\n\nBut ever since then, he and Simon spend a lot of time together. They go hiking every other Sunday in the morning and Simon often comes over to help my husband with the cars he's fixing up or play games while I'm at work. Simon only briefly greets me while often times not even bothering to greet his cousins.\n\nMy younger son told me he asked my husband for something but he told him he'll do it later and then forgot about it. It upset me because I feel like he's neglecting our sons while having no issues spending time with his nephew and always talking to him on the phone. Simon seems more like a son to him than our actual sons and it really bothers me.\n\nHe claims I'm overreacting and it's not a big deal. And that he tried to spend time with our sons but they don't seem all that interested in doing what he likes doing. I told him they're his sons and he should show more interest but he claims I'm being too pushy and overbearing.\n\nEvery time I bring it up with him he gets annoyed.", "ups": 1074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pziuu/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_needs_to_spend/", "num_comments": 357}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has neglected them and is still doing so. It's like Simon is his golden child when it's not even his own kid!\n\nThe current state is probably from years if not decades of your husband spending a lot of time, and favouring, Simon over his own kids. That's such a rubbish thing to do.\n\nIt's one thing to take Simon on and treat him as 'son-light' when Simon's father has been absent/less involved, but it's quite another thing to overcompensate for Simon's father's lack of effort/interest and take more of an interest in Simon than in his own kids.\n\nMaybe your sons would have developed more of an interest in their father's hobbies if your husband had put the same kind of effort and interest in including his own kids in his hobbies. Your sons may still have grown out of interest in your husband's hobbies but at least they would have a closer relationship from having been actively included as opposed to tagging along to an activity husband wants to do with Simon.\n\nYou need to have a real conversation with your husband about his behaviour, his favouritism, and how this has affected his own kids. It sounds like your older son has had to just accept this, and I guess it's not possible to go back in time and give him what he needed from his dad when he was 10 or 12 or 15 or 18, but your younger son is only 16 and struggling in school. That probably really eats away at his confidence. And then at home, his dad can't be arsed to take an interest in him because his dad is too busy with your son's cousin. Your husband is neglecting your teen son who probably really needs positive experiences with the adults in his life. I assume you try to be very involved with your younger son, but he also needs his dad. Mothers and fathers bring something different to the table and kids, ideally, would have both.\n\nMaybe this is something to talk about with a family therapist. If your husband refuses, you can at least go by yourself just to get a professional opinion on this situation.\n\nAre there other adult males in your/your younger son's life that you could involve move?

I think that's an issue IF he is coming yo YOUR home. I would talk to your husband about this and say that Simon needs to improve his attitude if he were to remain welcome at YOUR home. Simon doesn't have to become best buddies with you or your sons but he should behave in a polite manner which includes greeting you and your sons (if they are present), asking how you are doing, and replying if he is asked how he is doing. That's just manners and he should have them considering he is a grown man.\n* Your husband is neglecting his own kids in favour of spending time with Simon. I think that's an issue with regards to your younger son who is only 16 and still lives at home. Husband should show interest in what your youngest son is doing even if it's not his hobby or something he isn't interested in. It's called parenting. It sounds like the 16 year old is not very outdoorsy and maybe not so fit (complaining about the hiking trip), but maybe husband and him can find some kind of physical activity they both like (gym, (indoor) soccer, tennis, bouldering, or maybe something like snooker/pool/darts assuming a 16 year old is welcome there where you can do these things). I don't think you can force your husband to spend that much time with your 21 year old as he lives away for college, or does he still live at home? At that age most people have their own lives and possibly not that much interest in doing things with their parents. If your older son does ask for time with your husband and your husband refuses, then maybe it's time to talk to husband about this too.\n* I don't think you can stop husband from spending time with Simon, as long as husband doesn't neglect his own kids or you. If you are not comfortable with Simon being over at your house as much as he is, then that's another story. I can understand not wanting someone you don't like that much being around several days of the week. So if this bothers you, talk to your husband about it. What bothers you (is it Simon's rudeness, is it having a guest (any guest) at the house so often because you feel you can't freely enjoy the house then, etc).\n* Have you talked to both your sons about their relationship with their dad? Ask if they feel they can get as much time with husband if they want, whether husband is open to doing things THEY like or if husband says no to their suggested activities, etc.\n* I want to add that Simon shouldn't be coming over unannounced.

The older one is 21 and in college and works a part time job on the side. The younger one is 16 and still in high-school.\n\nMy husband's brother has two sons as well who are 24 and 28. The older one is very nice and polite but the younger one (let's call him Simon) had always been problematic since I can remember. He's a very picky eater, refuses to even bother engaging in a conversation unless he's interested in it and would always be the one getting fussy if we go somewhere on a family gathering. He hardly ever addresses me and whenever he used to come over whether by himself or with his brother, he barely managed to greet me. If I ask him personal questions, he shuts me down easily. \n\n\nHowever he and my husband seem to have a good friendship and even talk on the phone once or twice a week.\n\nMy husband's brother works two jobs and  wasn't always a very present father. So Simon had attached himself to my husband even as a kid because of availability and common interests. When he was around 5, Simon even used to say he wants to marry my husband. We all saw it as a joke and moved past it but I found the attachment odd since then.\n\nHe and my husband both like guns, hunting, video games and the same types of music. Even cars too which is my husband's main hobby these days.\n\nA few months ago Simon wanted to go on a hunting trip with his father but got refused so my husband offered to take him instead. I told him he should take our sons too and Simon's brother so it would be like a family bonding experience. \n\nHe agreed but apparently it didn't go well. My older son and Simon's brother didn't like it and my younger son was on his phone the whole time and complained since the hunting grounds are further away and require a lot of walking. My husband told me this and said he wouldn't force anyone else to come if they didn't want to.\n\nBut ever since then, he and Simon spend a lot of time together. They go hiking every other Sunday in the morning and Simon often comes over to help my husband with the cars he's fixing up or play games while I'm at work. Simon only briefly greets me while often times not even bothering to greet his cousins.\n\nMy younger son told me he asked my husband for something but he told him he'll do it later and then forgot about it. It upset me because I feel like he's neglecting our sons while having no issues spending time with his nephew and always talking to him on the phone. Simon seems more like a son to him than our actual sons and it really bothers me.\n\nHe claims I'm overreacting and it's not a big deal. And that he tried to spend time with our sons but they don't seem all that interested in doing what he likes doing. I told him they're his sons and he should show more interest but he claims I'm being too pushy and overbearing.\n\nEvery time I bring it up with him he gets annoyed.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your husband should make more effort. But you seem hellbent on scapegoating Simon for it, and undermining the validity of his bond with your husband. Simon's NOT responsible for your husband's bond with your sons (Simon probably wouldn't get this attention either, if he didn't share interests with your husband). \n\nAnd I'm absolutely disgusted with your comment that Simon (at age 5) would say he wanted to marry your husband. You raise this in the context, that you've found Simon's attachment to your husband 'odd' since then. So what was your problem?! Were you concerned the 5-year-old was a threat to your marriage, because said 5-year-old wanted to be the 'other woman'?! Or are you trying to imply Simon currently wants to f*** your husband?! You are trying to abnormalise Simon in a revolting way, based on a NORMAL childhood comment. \n\nIndeed, research has shown how common (and normal) such sentiments are, in young children. I remember I used to say I wanted to marry my Grandmother. It's entirely innocent. It's because young children don't really understand the differences between romantic/sexual love, vs. the familial love (that they feel for their attachment figures). They assume all love is basically the same. Meanwhile, children are told people marry, because they 'love each other'. \n\nAnd since young children know they love their attachment figures, they simply assume that means they will marry them. It does NOT imply inappropriate or sexual feelings towards the adult. You only dropped that irrelevant detail in, to try to pathologise Simon's bond with your husband. But his attachment to your husband is HEALTHY, especially since his own Dad isn't very involved. \n\nSimon shouldn't be offhand with you, no. He MIGHT be an asshole for that. But who knows? Maybe he picked up at a young age, that you had a bizarre, jealous, and disapproving attitude towards him (and his bond with your husband). Maybe he would have bonded better with YOU, if he'd detected enough positivity towards him - and if he wasn't picking up vibes, you want to interfere with his relationship with his Uncle. \n\nIt might also be that Simon has some sort of disorder, which influences his behaviour.

{"post": {"title": "AITA for not forcing my husband to apologize to my family?", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "selftext": "I (44F) was diagnosed with a very large but benign brain tumor earlier this year and had surgery to remove it. I was gravely sick for 3 months leading up to this, sleeping 15+ hours a day, vomiting every day multiple times a day and with severe headaches. My husband was a wreck as we didn\u2019t know my diagnosis until 11 days before the surgery; he barely slept bc he was terrified I would fall asleep and not wake up. Before the surgery the only family who came to see me in the hospital was one sister, my mom and my husband, and an aunt. After surgery I had impaired mobility, for a month I couldn\u2019t walk w/o a walker and someone holding me upright. But after my surgery I woke up and my parents and my husband were there. My parents asked how I was, and then my mother immediately told me she was taking my two kids on a trip to Puerto Rico, then she started talking about another vacation they had planned with my children that I had also not heard abt. I was confused as this was news to me and my brain was literally resetting itself, and they had not asked me. I was pretty curt with them and they left. The whole interaction bothered me so much that I asked them to stop by my house when I was discharged 5 days later so we could talk about it. It did not go well, they were there to be praised and when I brought up that I thought the conversation was inappropriate (and also that neither of them was there to even help me into the house when I got home - and I fell getting inside despite my husband trying his best to help me) they said they were offended. I told them I was offended as well, and my dad started yelling at me, telling me this was all somehow my husbands fault. My husband and kids were upstairs and heard everything. I yelled at them both to get out. My husband rushed to comfort me while I sobbed. The steroids were so awful I couldn\u2019t sleep, so my husband cdn\u2019t sleep either bc he had to keep an eye on me at all times. Unbeknownst to me my parents reached out to a friend of mine online and implied that they were concerned for my physical safety. The friend lives out of state and has never met my husband IRL but she reached out to him through FB and asked him probing questions, egged on by my parents. He was sleep deprived and disgusted with how my family treated me, so he vented to her abt my family, and how he was just trying to follow my wishes. He also called out my parents alcoholism. Things have been very strained with my family for the last 6 months and I was working on my relationship with my parents until yesterday when my dad brought up that the friend had sent him SS of her convo with my husband, and that he was offended by them and needed an apology (he has never apologized to me) My parents did just gift us money towards a house purchase, but I am against my husband being forced to apologize, and quite honestly I feel like he is also owed an apology.

I was gravely sick for 3 months leading up to this, sleeping 15+ hours a day, vomiting every day multiple times a day and with severe headaches. My husband was a wreck as we didn\u2019t know my diagnosis until 11 days before the surgery; he barely slept bc he was terrified I would fall asleep and not wake up. Before the surgery the only family who came to see me in the hospital was one sister, my mom and my husband, and an aunt. After surgery I had impaired mobility, for a month I couldn\u2019t walk w/o a walker and someone holding me upright. But after my surgery I woke up and my parents and my husband were there. My parents asked how I was, and then my mother immediately told me she was taking my two kids on a trip to Puerto Rico, then she started talking about another vacation they had planned with my children that I had also not heard abt. I was confused as this was news to me and my brain was literally resetting itself, and they had not asked me. I was pretty curt with them and they left. The whole interaction bothered me so much that I asked them to stop by my house when I was discharged 5 days later so we could talk about it. It did not go well, they were there to be praised and when I brought up that I thought the conversation was inappropriate (and also that neither of them was there to even help me into the house when I got home - and I fell getting inside despite my husband trying his best to help me) they said they were offended. I told them I was offended as well, and my dad started yelling at me, telling me this was all somehow my husbands fault. My husband and kids were upstairs and heard everything. I yelled at them both to get out. My husband rushed to comfort me while I sobbed. The steroids were so awful I couldn\u2019t sleep, so my husband cdn\u2019t sleep either bc he had to keep an eye on me at all times. Unbeknownst to me my parents reached out to a friend of mine online and implied that they were concerned for my physical safety. The friend lives out of state and has never met my husband IRL but she reached out to him through FB and asked him probing questions, egged on by my parents. He was sleep deprived and disgusted with how my family treated me, so he vented to her abt my family, and how he was just trying to follow my wishes. He also called out my parents alcoholism. Things have been very strained with my family for the last 6 months and I was working on my relationship with my parents until yesterday when my dad brought up that the friend had sent him SS of her convo with my husband, and that he was offended by them and needed an apology (he has never apologized to me) My parents did just gift us money towards a house purchase, but I am against my husband being forced to apologize, and quite honestly I feel like he is also owed an apology.

My parents are divorced, so there are 3 different places we could go and everybody wants to see us. My mum also lives alone and struggles with her mental health, so I feel bad leaving her on Christmas.\n\nWe haven't yet spent a single Christmas with Joe's family.\nEach year we have attempted to make arrangements, but it never works out.\nIt's difficult to stay with them for Christmas, as they don't have a spare room in their house. Hotels are expensive around Christmas time, and Joe and I are in agreement that we don't wish to stay in a crappy hotel over Christmas that costs a fortune.\nThe biggest issue is that Joe's family have a very large, territorial and aggressive dog that they struggle to control. When we have visited we have been forced to remain upstairs out of the way as this dog's behaviour is so unpredictable, and any time he's heard us he's lost his shit downstairs.\n\nWe are very fortunate to own a large house with 2 spare double bedrooms. This is perfect for welcoming Joe's family for Christmas.\nJoe has started to make arrangements for his family to come and stay over the holiday this year, which is lovely.\nThe problem is that his family will refuse to come without bringing their dog. I am very concerned about this because:\n- The dog has a history of aggression. I don't want to feel like I can't come downstairs to our kitchen (where he would stay overnight), or be scared just to walk around in my own home.\n- Joe thinks the dog can stay outside in our small garden most of the time, but we can't predict the weather that far in advance, and his barking could disturb our neighbours on Christmas day.\n- I am worried about the safety and wellbeing of my cats. They will feel anxious, and could be torn apart!\n- Everyone will be stressed out trying to control the dog.\n\nI shared my concerns and Joe told me that although he understands why I'm worried, he genuinely doesn't believe this will be a problem.\nHe shared that they plan to bring a large crate to keep the dog in the kitchen, and he can be in our garden, or be out on walks most of the time. I just can't see this logistically working.\n\nJoe has since told me that he already told his family that it won't be a problem (before consulting me). I was obviously upset about this too.\nI don't want to be TA and tell him his family aren't allowed to come for Christmas, especially as we have never spent a Christmas with them.

My parents are divorced, so there are 3 different places we could go and everybody wants to see us. My mum also lives alone and struggles with her mental health, so I feel bad leaving her on Christmas.\n\nWe haven't yet spent a single Christmas with Joe's family.\nEach year we have attempted to make arrangements, but it never works out.\nIt's difficult to stay with them for Christmas, as they don't have a spare room in their house. Hotels are expensive around Christmas time, and Joe and I are in agreement that we don't wish to stay in a crappy hotel over Christmas that costs a fortune.\nThe biggest issue is that Joe's family have a very large, territorial and aggressive dog that they struggle to control. When we have visited we have been forced to remain upstairs out of the way as this dog's behaviour is so unpredictable, and any time he's heard us he's lost his shit downstairs.\n\nWe are very fortunate to own a large house with 2 spare double bedrooms. This is perfect for welcoming Joe's family for Christmas.\nJoe has started to make arrangements for his family to come and stay over the holiday this year, which is lovely.\nThe problem is that his family will refuse to come without bringing their dog. I am very concerned about this because:\n- The dog has a history of aggression. I don't want to feel like I can't come downstairs to our kitchen (where he would stay overnight), or be scared just to walk around in my own home.\n- Joe thinks the dog can stay outside in our small garden most of the time, but we can't predict the weather that far in advance, and his barking could disturb our neighbours on Christmas day.\n- I am worried about the safety and wellbeing of my cats. They will feel anxious, and could be torn apart!\n- Everyone will be stressed out trying to control the dog.\n\nI shared my concerns and Joe told me that although he understands why I'm worried, he genuinely doesn't believe this will be a problem.\nHe shared that they plan to bring a large crate to keep the dog in the kitchen, and he can be in our garden, or be out on walks most of the time. I just can't see this logistically working.\n\nJoe has since told me that he already told his family that it won't be a problem (before consulting me).

She got us on a three way call where she started crying because she was so stressed.

She calls me, yelling, saying how I'm screwing her life, I explained that hey I felt really backed into a corner this morning and I wasn't okay with that and she was like \"why don't you get this, it's just the way it is\" and it got to a point where nothing I was saying was getting through to her and she said she didn't think we could be friends after this and to never contact her again.

I said I needed time to think about this and that upset her because the \"apartment could go at any minute\" she kind of throws me under the bus about the labor she's done searching and she doesn't want to do it anymore. \n\nI got off the phone and called different people for advice. All said \"get out now\". I sent her a text saying \"thank you for all you've done but I don't think we should search for apartments together. I hope we can be friends and best of luck\". She calls me, yelling, saying how I'm screwing her life, I explained that hey I felt really backed into a corner this morning and I wasn't okay with that and she was like \"why don't you get this, it's just the way it is\" and it got to a point where nothing I was saying was getting through to her and she said she didn't think we could be friends after this and to never contact her again. Which, I'm fine with, after this.\n\nThen her dad follows up later and says this: \"I'm glad I tested your character before I did something stupid and signed a document that you would've backed out of at the first toothbrush left out.  Talk about immature.  My daughter is right you're a snowflake piece of shit who couldn't handle a basic business transaction to protect me from people like you.

I (26f) am their only child together. My dad has two adult kids from his first marriage. Both my half siblings are in their late 30s. My mom has always tried to be seen as a parent and a second mom to my half siblings, who lost their mom when they were small kids. They never accepted or wanted my mom and it broke her heart. I watched it happen over and over again when I was a child. She was a good mom to me when I was little and she was there for me. But I always knew her heart was breaking when it came to my half siblings.\n\nOver the years it got a little worse when my half siblings both had children with their spouses. My mom is not grandma or stepgrandma to those kids. She's just lady grandpa is married to. My mom has broken down and I have supported her so many times.\n\nI had my first child this summer and I thought it might help my mom. She would finally have a grandchild and could pour her love into him. But she wasn't there for me or him like she wanted to be there for my half siblings and their kids.\n\nA few days ago my half brother told my mom she would be the last person they would let babysit the kids for them. They were struggling to find someone and mom offered. She came over to me and started crying about being rejected by kids and grandkids and how hard it was for her to love them all so much and want to be part of their lives but to be kept at a distance and told they don't even want to use you for free babysitting.\n\nShe never asked about me or my son. She just came to lean on me again and I was dealing with my son struggling with sleep. I was already tired and feeling kind of drained and to hear that she offered my half brother help when she knew the struggles my husband and I were having with our son and never offered us help. I couldn't deal with it.

I (26f) am their only child together. My dad has two adult kids from his first marriage. Both my half siblings are in their late 30s. My mom has always tried to be seen as a parent and a second mom to my half siblings, who lost their mom when they were small kids. They never accepted or wanted my mom and it broke her heart. I watched it happen over and over again when I was a child. She was a good mom to me when I was little and she was there for me. But I always knew her heart was breaking when it came to my half siblings.\n\nOver the years it got a little worse when my half siblings both had children with their spouses. My mom is not grandma or stepgrandma to those kids. She's just lady grandpa is married to. My mom has broken down and I have supported her so many times.\n\nI had my first child this summer and I thought it might help my mom. She would finally have a grandchild and could pour her love into him. But she wasn't there for me or him like she wanted to be there for my half siblings and their kids.\n\nA few days ago my half brother told my mom she would be the last person they would let babysit the kids for them. They were struggling to find someone and mom offered. She came over to me and started crying about being rejected by kids and grandkids and how hard it was for her to love them all so much and want to be part of their lives but to be kept at a distance and told they don't even want to use you for free babysitting.\n\nShe never asked about me or my son. She just came to lean on me again and I was dealing with my son struggling with sleep. I was already tired and feeling kind of drained and to hear that she offered my half brother help when she knew the struggles my husband and I were having with our son and never offered us help. I couldn't deal with it. I told her I did not want to hear it and she needed to leave because I am tired of always hearing about how much she wants their love and acceptance when she has a child and grandchild who would love to have her around. She cried even harder and I told her I could not deal with her and made sure she left.\n\nAfterward my dad said I had been totally harsh and claimed my mom was distraught when she got home.

With this job, I get a company vehicle. Before I accepted the offer, I was talking to my GF about the company car and I mentioned instead of selling my vehicle, I\u2019d let her use it in the winter.\n\nHer car is pretty bad in snow, even with snow tires on the car. Also, she\u2019s been having issues with it starting to stall while she\u2019s driving, especially when it gets really cold. \n\nHer car is paid off and between bills we split and her student loans, she can\u2019t afford a new car, so I figured this would save her the headache and we could talk about a newer car for her next year.\n\nAfter I accepted my offer, I looked to see what my car was worth and it\u2019s a lot more than I was thinking. I personally could really use that money, so I decided I would sell my car now while it\u2019s still worth that amount. \n\nI told my girlfriend when she got home from work and she lost her mind. She asked what she\u2019s supposed to do in the winter now, so I told her what the car is worth and asked if she\u2019d want to buy it from me, and that just pissed her off even more.\n\nI personally think she\u2019s being selfish. It\u2019s my car. I even offered to let her buy it from me, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for her. But, I need to know, AITA?\n\nEdit: so I am the AH, but it is what it is.

Before I accepted the offer, I was talking to my GF about the company car and I mentioned instead of selling my vehicle, I\u2019d let her use it in the winter.\n\nHer car is pretty bad in snow, even with snow tires on the car. Also, she\u2019s been having issues with it starting to stall while she\u2019s driving, especially when it gets really cold. \n\nHer car is paid off and between bills we split and her student loans, she can\u2019t afford a new car, so I figured this would save her the headache and we could talk about a newer car for her next year.\n\nAfter I accepted my offer, I looked to see what my car was worth and it\u2019s a lot more than I was thinking. I personally could really use that money, so I decided I would sell my car now while it\u2019s still worth that amount. \n\nI told my girlfriend when she got home from work and she lost her mind. She asked what she\u2019s supposed to do in the winter now, so I told her what the car is worth and asked if she\u2019d want to buy it from me, and that just pissed her off even more.\n\nI personally think she\u2019s being selfish. It\u2019s my car. I even offered to let her buy it from me, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for her. But, I need to know, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's one thing to get into a minor disagreement, but another to do this where she'll have all winter to think about this; and if the winter is really bad she will have a really long time to think. Being on the wrong side of her friends and family is not going to help your cause; she will be hearing how she could do better and if she values any of their opinions it's not going to help your relationship.\n\nHopefully you have other redeeming qualities beyond the standard cooking, cleaning, and doing laundry.

Everyone was in the living room so I brought a out the brownie tray, icecream and a few bowls.\n\nEveryone seemed to enjoy them and told me that the brownies were amazing. We were all just catching up after for a while when my aunt suddenly mentioned she was on a new diet that included avoiding eggs.\n\nI was surprised, because my brownies had egg in them and she had always eaten them before this. She knows the recipie because it's something my cousins and I created. I panicked for a second because I didn't want to upset her, so I told my mum first and she said I should tell my aunt but it's not my fault since she didn't tell us before.\n\nI told my aunt and she completely freaked out saying that I did it on purpose and was trying to \"poison\" her. I told her I didn't know, and she had always eaten eggs before. She still insisted that I did it on purpose and I gave up trying to argue against her.\n\nMy parents don't think I'm in the wrong.

I have baked these for them before and they have always enjoyed them.\n\nSo when they came over yesterday, I bought some vanilla icecream and served it to them with the brownies after dinner. Everyone was in the living room so I brought a out the brownie tray, icecream and a few bowls.\n\nEveryone seemed to enjoy them and told me that the brownies were amazing. We were all just catching up after for a while when my aunt suddenly mentioned she was on a new diet that included avoiding eggs.\n\nI was surprised, because my brownies had egg in them and she had always eaten them before this. She knows the recipie because it's something my cousins and I created. I panicked for a second because I didn't want to upset her, so I told my mum first and she said I should tell my aunt but it's not my fault since she didn't tell us before.\n\nI told my aunt and she completely freaked out saying that I did it on purpose and was trying to \"poison\" her. I told her I didn't know, and she had always eaten eggs before. She still insisted that I did it on purpose and I gave up trying to argue against her.\n\nMy parents don't think I'm in the wrong. My uncle and cousins sided with her last night, but one of my cousins texted saying they didn't think I was wrong but just had to side with their mum.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's hot and (normally) no one ever comes in my room. I was on my computer, just browsing YouTube, and heard three quick knocks at my door. Before I had time to do ANYTHING, he opened the door and walked inside. I mean there was zero time between the knocking and the door opening, he was basically opening the door as he made the third knock. I stared at him wide-eyed as he began to explain that I might be needed to help my mom with something later and to keep my phone charged and next to me so she can call me. Part way through he stops, realizes I'm nude, and says \"Do you HAVE to be naked?\"\n\nHe had a talk with me today about how I should respect his house and wear clothes at all times. It should be noted that we live in a two-story home, and the second floor is pretty much entirely \"my\" space. I'm the only one of us who sleeps up here, and there's nothing important up here so the only reason people ever come up is to get/talk to me. If I need to leave my room when I'm naked, I put on clothes. People don't want to see me naked and I don't want people to see me naked. But it's just so uncomfortable to wear clothes when it's so hot out. Everyone else knocks and waits for permission to enter, but not dad. He just barges in, and somehow it's MY fault.

It's hot and (normally) no one ever comes in my room. I was on my computer, just browsing YouTube, and heard three quick knocks at my door. Before I had time to do ANYTHING, he opened the door and walked inside. I mean there was zero time between the knocking and the door opening, he was basically opening the door as he made the third knock. I stared at him wide-eyed as he began to explain that I might be needed to help my mom with something later and to keep my phone charged and next to me so she can call me. Part way through he stops, realizes I'm nude, and says \"Do you HAVE to be naked?\"\n\nHe had a talk with me today about how I should respect his house and wear clothes at all times. It should be noted that we live in a two-story home, and the second floor is pretty much entirely \"my\" space. I'm the only one of us who sleeps up here, and there's nothing important up here so the only reason people ever come up is to get/talk to me. If I need to leave my room when I'm naked, I put on clothes. People don't want to see me naked and I don't want people to see me naked. But it's just so uncomfortable to wear clothes when it's so hot out. Everyone else knocks and waits for permission to enter, but not dad. He just barges in, and somehow it's MY fault.

Our twins are in the 8th grade. Our son, Bayard and our daughter, Addilyn.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nOn Monday, my husband and I both got texts from Bayard that he needed to talk to us when we got home. We found this odd and were talking to each other before the kids got home. Once they were home, we spoke to Bayard in his room. He told us that he had heard that Addilyn was being rude to her History teacher, this teacher also has Bayard in a different period. The teacher is also Bayard\u2019s baseball coach. Bayard and his friends look up to her, she knows so much about the sport and will talk to them about all the games going on, and she also gives them advice on things. My husband and I have never seen Bayard that mad, he was red in the face. He said he didn\u2019t know much of the specific details, but he heard from some kids that Addilyn asked the teacher if she was on her period.\r  \n\r  \nWe emailed the teacher and got a reply on Tuesday, she admitted everything Bayard said was true and gave us some of the details. What she said was absolutely horrifying, she said it started when Addilyn was talking to some friends while she was trying to instruct the class, when she told her to stop, Addilyn refused. The kids were learning about Thomas Jefferson and one of the kids asked if he was autistic, as the kid had read it somewhere. Addilyn and her friends then made some joke about autistic people, who basically called them stupid.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the kids on the baseball team and Bayard\u2019s friend, is autistic, and Addilyn is very aware of that. He is a really bright and sweet kid. The teacher told her that wasn\u2019t very nice and tried to educate them a bit on what autism was, this is when Addilyn said that the teacher was \u201coverreacting\u201d and asked her if she was on her period.\r  \n\r  \nThe teacher admitted she didn\u2019t call because she has had bad experiences with these types of phone calls in the past and was afraid of how\u2019d we react, we told her she didn\u2019t need to worry. \r  \n\r  \nAfter this, my husband and I talked and agreed that Addilyn would lose her phone for at least a few weeks and she needed to write an apology letter both to her teacher and to the boy she made fun of, even though he wasn\u2019t in that period of her class.\r  \n\r  \nAddilyn wrote an apology letter to both but they seemed insincere and potentially AI generated, and when asked about it, she admitted she used AI to write it. We told her it needs to be genuine but she\u2019s refusing to write a letter. She\u2019s saying \u201cforcing\u201d her to write an apology is going against her right to express her true thoughts, and is calling us named, including a-holes.

Our twins are in the 8th grade. Our son, Bayard and our daughter, Addilyn.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nOn Monday, my husband and I both got texts from Bayard that he needed to talk to us when we got home. We found this odd and were talking to each other before the kids got home. Once they were home, we spoke to Bayard in his room. He told us that he had heard that Addilyn was being rude to her History teacher, this teacher also has Bayard in a different period. The teacher is also Bayard\u2019s baseball coach. Bayard and his friends look up to her, she knows so much about the sport and will talk to them about all the games going on, and she also gives them advice on things. My husband and I have never seen Bayard that mad, he was red in the face. He said he didn\u2019t know much of the specific details, but he heard from some kids that Addilyn asked the teacher if she was on her period.\r  \n\r  \nWe emailed the teacher and got a reply on Tuesday, she admitted everything Bayard said was true and gave us some of the details. What she said was absolutely horrifying, she said it started when Addilyn was talking to some friends while she was trying to instruct the class, when she told her to stop, Addilyn refused. The kids were learning about Thomas Jefferson and one of the kids asked if he was autistic, as the kid had read it somewhere. Addilyn and her friends then made some joke about autistic people, who basically called them stupid.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the kids on the baseball team and Bayard\u2019s friend, is autistic, and Addilyn is very aware of that. He is a really bright and sweet kid. The teacher told her that wasn\u2019t very nice and tried to educate them a bit on what autism was, this is when Addilyn said that the teacher was \u201coverreacting\u201d and asked her if she was on her period.\r  \n\r  \nThe teacher admitted she didn\u2019t call because she has had bad experiences with these types of phone calls in the past and was afraid of how\u2019d we react, we told her she didn\u2019t need to worry. \r  \n\r  \nAfter this, my husband and I talked and agreed that Addilyn would lose her phone for at least a few weeks and she needed to write an apology letter both to her teacher and to the boy she made fun of, even though he wasn\u2019t in that period of her class.\r  \n\r  \nAddilyn wrote an apology letter to both but they seemed insincere and potentially AI generated, and when asked about it, she admitted she used AI to write it. We told her it needs to be genuine but she\u2019s refusing to write a letter. She\u2019s saying \u201cforcing\u201d her to write an apology is going against her right to express her true thoughts, and is calling us named, including a-holes.

My sister (Jane) is pregnant and this trip is their babymoon.\n\nJane's husband (Charles); My husband 31M (Victor)\n\nBackground - I don't like how Charles speaks to or treats Jane in general. Charles often argues and raises his voice at Jane throughout the day about trivial things.  I've talked to Jane about his behavior before and she's told me, \"I realize how he sounds when he talks to people; we fight about it all the time\" and \"I think he needs anger management.\" It always ends with her apologizing or making excuses.\n\nWeekend 1: The entire time we spent with Charles was quite exhausting and miserable for me. He argued with my sister multiple times. When Victor speaks, I can see Charles rolling his eyes, nudging Jane's elbow, and \"whispering\" snide remarks to her; he seems to think these all go unnoticed by us. He usually talks down to me, cuts me off, and enjoys flaunting his knowledge. My brother, mom, and some cousins also find him a difficult person to be around.\n\nCharles and Jane leave my house and the next day I am overwhelmed by the stress and how uncomfortable Charles always makes me feel. Victor finds me crying and thinks they should not come back to sleep in our home because it is so stressful for me, but agrees we should still hang out with them out of our house. I cried about it because I don't want to put my sister in a difficult situation, especially with her being pregnant and trying to enjoy a vacation. \n\nI end up telling Jane how I feel: \"Charles is rude/disrespectful to you, me, and Victor. I still want to spend time with you while you're in town, but I need separate time to decompress after being with Charles. I love you but this is the boundary I need to set for this dynamic to work.\"\n\nShe cries and says if she doesn't sleep here, she will \"need a break\" from me.\n\nI apologized to her and emphasized this is about needing a break from Charles, not Jane. (both during a phone call and text)\n\nCharles calls me and it goes terribly. He talks over me. He tells me he is \"disappointed\" because I am \"not supporting\" my sister's pregnancy by not allowing him to sleep at my place. \"Jane is bringing life into this world. Our feelings aren't what matter, Jane is what matters right now. If we don't sleep there, we won't be seeing you.\"\n\nWeekend 2 starts today. I haven't heard from Jane.

My sister (Jane) is pregnant and this trip is their babymoon.\n\nJane's husband (Charles); My husband 31M (Victor)\n\nBackground - I don't like how Charles speaks to or treats Jane in general. Charles often argues and raises his voice at Jane throughout the day about trivial things.  I've talked to Jane about his behavior before and she's told me, \"I realize how he sounds when he talks to people; we fight about it all the time\" and \"I think he needs anger management.\" It always ends with her apologizing or making excuses.\n\nWeekend 1: The entire time we spent with Charles was quite exhausting and miserable for me. He argued with my sister multiple times. When Victor speaks, I can see Charles rolling his eyes, nudging Jane's elbow, and \"whispering\" snide remarks to her; he seems to think these all go unnoticed by us. He usually talks down to me, cuts me off, and enjoys flaunting his knowledge. My brother, mom, and some cousins also find him a difficult person to be around.\n\nCharles and Jane leave my house and the next day I am overwhelmed by the stress and how uncomfortable Charles always makes me feel. Victor finds me crying and thinks they should not come back to sleep in our home because it is so stressful for me, but agrees we should still hang out with them out of our house. I cried about it because I don't want to put my sister in a difficult situation, especially with her being pregnant and trying to enjoy a vacation. \n\nI end up telling Jane how I feel: \"Charles is rude/disrespectful to you, me, and Victor. I still want to spend time with you while you're in town, but I need separate time to decompress after being with Charles. I love you but this is the boundary I need to set for this dynamic to work.\"\n\nShe cries and says if she doesn't sleep here, she will \"need a break\" from me.\n\nI apologized to her and emphasized this is about needing a break from Charles, not Jane. (both during a phone call and text)\n\nCharles calls me and it goes terribly. He talks over me. He tells me he is \"disappointed\" because I am \"not supporting\" my sister's pregnancy by not allowing him to sleep at my place. \"Jane is bringing life into this world. Our feelings aren't what matter, Jane is what matters right now. If we don't sleep there, we won't be seeing you.\"\n\nWeekend 2 starts today. I haven't heard from Jane. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I told my sister I need a break from her husband bc he's rude/disrespectful, and essentially told them to get their own place when they come visit\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The reason we do that is because if some kids get to use their phones and others don't, it creates a really difficult situation for the teacher to manage.\n\nIt's easy to say oh teachers should follow this ILP and that IEP and the other 504, but y'all obviously have no experience managing a classroom.

She's been doing good in school and good at home.\n\nAnyways, I got to her party, and I had left the toyhome. It was going to be a surprise i could give her after her party, since I checked with everybody else getting her a gift and nobody was getting what I got. I thought this was a great plan. I bring my little gift bag of a few things she liked (to be specific, a few candy bars and a 20$ gift card) and give it to her when it was time to open the gifts. She opened it, and looked at me in an annoyed way. \"This is all you got me? Just candys bars and a goft card?\" I was shocked by what she said. I was debating on whether I should give her her other present, but she had been extremely rude, so I decided to hold on.\n\nI pulled her mom aside, and told her I was gonna wait until christmas, or maybe her next birthday to give her the gift because my neice had been rude. She asked me \"Why cant you just give it to her now? You already bought it.\" I told her it was because her daughter was rude, and i didnt feel like giving it to her today. My sister got mad, and told me to leave the party then. I shrugged, and left.\n\nOnce I got home, i put the unopened box in my basement. I checked my phone, and my sister had called me an asshole for not giving my neice the car. I responded that her neice was rude, and I didnt feel like giving a rude eleven year old an expensive toy right now. My sister and my mom say i should just give her the toy, and im staying firm.

I didnt give my ungratful neice a 300$ present?\n\nSo recently, I (32F) bought a few presents for my neices birthday, which was a few days ago. My neice is 11, and shes been wanting this almost 300$ thing. It was expensive, but I had been saving up for it because I thought she had deserved it. She's been doing good in school and good at home.\n\nAnyways, I got to her party, and I had left the toyhome. It was going to be a surprise i could give her after her party, since I checked with everybody else getting her a gift and nobody was getting what I got. I thought this was a great plan. I bring my little gift bag of a few things she liked (to be specific, a few candy bars and a 20$ gift card) and give it to her when it was time to open the gifts. She opened it, and looked at me in an annoyed way. \"This is all you got me? Just candys bars and a goft card?\" I was shocked by what she said. I was debating on whether I should give her her other present, but she had been extremely rude, so I decided to hold on.\n\nI pulled her mom aside, and told her I was gonna wait until christmas, or maybe her next birthday to give her the gift because my neice had been rude. She asked me \"Why cant you just give it to her now? You already bought it.\" I told her it was because her daughter was rude, and i didnt feel like giving it to her today. My sister got mad, and told me to leave the party then. I shrugged, and left.\n\nOnce I got home, i put the unopened box in my basement. I checked my phone, and my sister had called me an asshole for not giving my neice the car. I responded that her neice was rude, and I didnt feel like giving a rude eleven year old an expensive toy right now. My sister and my mom say i should just give her the toy, and im staying firm. They keep calling me an asshole, and Im starting to think im in the wrong.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"post": {"title": "AITA for cancelling my parents invitation to go on a 5* holiday with us?", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "selftext": "So, we were planning and talking about this trip for a full year and we were all excited to be going together, in part going on holiday and in part an extension of our wedding anniversary celebrations which were before this trip. Their preference was always to go together with us rather than by themselves, which we also offered and discussed.\n\n1. We wanted to treat my(30f) parents (62f +59m) to a special, 5\\* holiday for their big anniversary. We already had a good, tried and tested hotel - it is the same hotel we went to for our honeymoon so we knew it would be perfect, and that especially my mum, would absolutely love it. As my parents live in a different country to us, and would struggle to get around in a foreign country (they don't know english), my husband(30m) made the effort to arrange the flights in a way that would mean we would arrive on the same day and also at similar times of the day to make it as easy as possible for my parents, even though we would have to drive 3h to the airport in our country - it was never an issue but is a reminder that all the effort put into making this trip was basically futile.\n2. Long story short, my mum is mad at me (for something that is ridiculous, but I still apologised for - details in comments) and relations between my mum and my dad are also strained to say the least. She wouldn't speak to me or him on their anniversary celebration which we flew to only because my father asked me to come - hoping all will be resolved - that did not happen. Last time she was mad at me, she wouldn't speak to me for a whole year. It is always really risky with her, she is either in good mood or bad mood, and when she is in bad mood she ruins everything for everyone. We (me, my husband and my father) suspect she is either bipolar or has a border personality disorder, but of course she will not go to a psychiatrist. My dad seems to have developed a mild drinking problem which is worrying but I digress.\n3. As we are going together, and it is our only proper holiday this year, I can't let anything destroy it. This is also taking a big toll on my relationship with my husband.

My mum also decided to come with him for the 10 days, even though usually she stayed at home and preferred visiting for weekends. Apart from renovating the house, we also wanted to spend some leisure time together so we arranged to go shopping with my mum, go on a trip at the weekend and have a good time, not just work and we communicated this to my parents.\n\n\\-\n\n**2.** When they arrived we knew something was off, and that they must have got into a fight - unfortunately this is a very frequent situation of my mother completely ignoring my father or being mad at him. She wouldn't acknowledge him, but as the days went by the mood got lighter and lighter, we spent nice evenings laughing, talking and cooking. During the day we were renovating the house, so me and my husband were running errands to get things for the house.\n\n\\-\n\n**3.** So one day we went to get tiles for the bathroom and when we came back my mum was in a good mood, asking: shall we make coffee? - this was a daily routine for us to drink coffee together. As we came out of the car we noticed she had been on her knees, scrapping weeds of the paving blocks on our driveway, cleaning windows etc. - she didn't have any work clothes so she was doing it in joggers and a vest top. So I said something along the lines of, \"wow you shouldn't be doing this, it should be me doing this not you. I feel ashamed in front of my neighbours for you to be doing this work, when I should be doing this\" (the street can see everything happening in front of our house).\n\nThen she just stormed off, not saying a word. She didn't want to drink coffee anymore and was upset despite me instantly going after her and apologising for my words. My husband also went to say to her that we really appreciate her helping us around the house and that we didn't mean to upset her and we are sorry if we caused her upset. He also told her the day before not to do the weed scrapping as he will deal with it and that he feels bad to see her do it - she didn't seem to be upset then.\n\n\\-\n\n**4.** So now she was mad and upset, she wouldn't leave her room, I brought her coffee, breakfast, dinner and supper each day for next 2-3 days and was apologising and saying sorry but this didn't do anything. Then she deteriorated and wanted my dad to buy her a flight back on the same/next day which cost a fortune - he bought her the flight, my husband drove her to the airport and that was it.\n\n\\-\n\n**5.** Then, couple of weeks after, my father begged us to come to their anniversary, which we did, even though my mum texted she doesn't have any contact with me. We bought my mum flowers, and then we bought a giant bouquet for their anniversary - but my mum wouldn't still speak to us. The anniversary was a disaster as well as she wouldn't speak to my dad during the whole thing. We then flew back home and couple weeks after she wouldn't even write a simple text to us on our anniversary.\n\n\\-\n\n**6.** So my mum will not call, text or speak to us. My dad seems to have my mum talking to him again but we are not there so we don't know what the situation is - he also is afraid to speak to me in fear of her finding out and being mad at him for that. Apparently she is telling everyone around her that they are going on holiday - even though we have all their flight and hotel details and she hasn't spoken to me for two months. She also was mad at me for letting her go to the airport, when it was herself that requested a ticket be bought for her to return home early.\n\n\\-\n\n**7. TLDR:** I feel like my mum has been messing with my head my whole life, in the past I already had to run from my parents home and move out as living with her was unbearable.

Their preference was always to go together rather than us just buying them the trip, which we also offered and discussed.  \nWe wanted to treat my(30f) parents (62f +59m) to a special, 5\\* holiday for their big anniversary. We already had a good, tried and tested hotel - it is the same hotel we went to for our honeymoon so we knew it would be perfect, and that especially my mum, would absolutely love it.  \nAs my parents, live in a different country to us, and would struggle to get around in a foreign country (they don't know english), my husband(30m) made the effort to arrange the flights in a way that would mean we would arrive on the same day and also at similar times of the day to make it as easy as possible for my parents, even though we would have to drive 3h to the airport in our country - it was never an issue but hurts us now, because of all the effort put into making this trip work.  \nLong story short, my mum is mad at me (for something that is ridiculous, but I still apologised for) and relations between my mum and my dad are also strained to say the least - she wouldn't speak to me or him on their anniversary celebration which we went to only because my father asked me to come, hoping all be resolved. Last time she was mad at me, she wouldn't speak to me for a whole year. It is always really risky with her, she is either in good mood or bad mood, and when she is in bad mood she ruins everything for everyone. We (me, my husband and my father) suspect she is either bipolar or has a border personality disorder, but of course she will not go to a psychiatrist. My dad seems to have developed a mild drinking problem which is worrying but I digress.\n\nAs we are going together, and it is our only proper holiday this year, I can't let anything destroy it. This is also taking a big toll on my relationship with my husband. How do I know that even if she says that she wants to go on holiday with us, she won't turn around and say that she wants flights back home in a couple of days into holiday, or how do we know she doesn't get mad at me for a little nonsense?  \nWe will lose money for flights but at least we can get some money back for the hotel. The worst thing about this is that we feel like we are the bad ones here because we are the ones who have invited them to come with us but the bad relations between me and my mum, and my father and my mum are absolutely not our fault and we refuse to be dragged into their problems. We tried everything we could to restore good relations with my mum and nothing has worked - she won't speak to me, she hasn't even texted us on our anniversary day.  \nAITA for deciding that me and my husband are going to go on holiday without them, given the situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But your mother told you not to and she was the one holding the grudge.  So the right answer would have been, sorry dad, but mom is still holding a grudge and this isn\u2019t going to end well until she is done holding the grudge and she reestablishes contact.\n\nYour dad is probably drinking because after years of dealing with his wife\u2019s behavior and the consequences of her behavior, he is losing his patience and drinking to cope.  Your dad can\u2019t fix your mother.\n\nNo amount of apologies can get your mother to drop her grudge.  So you need to stop apologizing when she has a hissy fit and let her go into her cave.  Stop poking the bear in the cave, it doesn\u2019t end well.\n\nSo, regarding the trip, you should be honest with her.  Because she is currently holding a grudge and not speaking to you, you are canceling the trip (just cancel her and your dad\u2019s tickets).  That you don\u2019t want to offend or bother her, so the trip is cancelled.  Say nothing more.  Cancel their tickets and then enjoy the vacation with your husband.  She may extend her grudge because you were honest, there is no way to know.  But lying to her isn\u2019t going to help or shorten her grudge.\n\nGoing forward, you need to decide how and when you are going to interact with her.  Obviously telling her to not do something she was doing (pulling weeds) was enough for her to flip out and hold a grudge.  So, you need to let her do whatever she is doing because if you suggest she not do it or do something else, she will have a fit and hold a grudge because she doesn\u2019t want anyone telling her what to do or suggesting what she should do, and her only mechanism for responding to it is to hold a grudge for weeks/months.  These are not normal behaviors, but at this point she will never go to therapy because she doesn\u2019t think she is doing anything wrong.\n\nDo not schedule anymore trips for them.  Part of her grudge thing could be that you wanted to treat her to a trip she didn\u2019t want to go on and he looked for a convenient other issue to hold a grudge so that you would cancel a trip that she didn\u2019t want and she wouldn\u2019t have to go.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "shout-out-1234", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "She's not speaking to you?

I had recently talked to my oldest sister who had mentioned a special trip with her daughter to Paris, I was really excited for her. She failed to mention that it was with my 2 brothers, their families and our other sister. I still would have been excited for her. When my dad finally responded to my text asking if my siblings were all on a trip together I was told I was being dramatic and needed to get over it because I wouldn't have been able to afford it so they didn't invite me. My siblings are all well off and I am disabled and barely making ends meet on SSI. I told my dad it wasn't about me not going, it was about not even being invited or told.  He said he wasn't invited either and I didn't see him whining.\n\nI don't think it's the same at all. I just wish they would have asked me and let me decide for myself if I could go or not. It just sucks so badly, I feel like they are ashamed of me. I already feel less than by society as a whole and now my family. It's made me incredibly depressed like why am I even here, the people that are supposed to love me would rather believe I don't exist. I ended the night crying and blocked everyone on everything.\n\nEdit to add: the blocking wasn't just because of this. This is just the final straw on the camels back.\n\nEdit 2: I never expect them to pay for me and especially for an expensive trip like this.

I had recently talked to my oldest sister who had mentioned a special trip with her daughter to Paris, I was really excited for her. She failed to mention that it was with my 2 brothers, their families and our other sister. I still would have been excited for her. When my dad finally responsed to my text asking if my siblings were all on a trip together I was told I was being dramatic and needed to get over it because I wouldn't have been able to afford it so they didn't invite me. My siblings are all well off and I am disabled and barely making ends meet on SSI. I told my dad it wasn't about me not going, it was about not even being invited or told.  He said he wasn't invited either and I didn't see him whining.\n\nI don't think it's the same at all. I just wish they would have asked me and let me decide for myself if I could go or not. It just sucks so badly, I feel like they are ashamed of me. I already feel less than by society as a whole and now my family. It's made me incredibly depressed like why am I even here, the people that are supposed to love me would rather believe I don't exist.

There were zero tells/ mentions that she may be special needs. \n\n2 days after hiring her (she\u2019s not supposed to start until this upcoming week) her father came in and introduced himself to me. He was polite, and thanked me for hiring his daughter and left his phone number, telling me to call him after I\u2019m off. I was confused by this as I\u2019ve never dealt with a situation like this. But I did call him. \n\nHe thanked me again but then said his daughter has severe anxiety and a \u201cslow learner\u201d and that I need to make special accommodations for her.

He said that if it is very busy, it is better to just let her sit in the back room and watch YouTube. \n\n- her school comes first (which I understand) but he said when she has \u201csignificant\u201d homework she will need to call off. \n\n- give her plenty of compliments and let the other staff know to go the extra mile to make her feel welcome. \n\n- if she does make a mistake, not to discuss it with her but to call him. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about employment law and not sure if I could be in legal trouble, but like every state we have at-will employment. I called the owner to tell him about this and he said to use my discretion. I want to call the father back and say I cannot make these accommodations, and if she does need these accommodations I will have to rescind the job offer. \n\nI feel for the girl, like I said she was very sweet. But at the same time I do have a business to run, I\u2019m not a special ed teacher. What is the point of hiring her when I will need to be over staffed to accommodate for her? I just can\u2019t do it. So right now I\u2019m thinking calling her dad tomorrow and letting him know that she will be treated like every other employee and if this won\u2019t work for her than she cannot work here. Would I be an asshole for that\n\nEdit: hey y\u2019all thanks for the input. I\u2019ve decided I am going to give her the job and just see how it goes. If she can\u2019t handle it I\u2019ll just let her go.", "ups": 2866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pdns1/wibta_if_i_rescind_a_job_offer_that_i_previously/", "num_comments": 466}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Owner said prove it. Challenged the dad to work the line on a busy night along with his son to see who could keep up with the orders. The son completely dominated over his dad.

Yes, the ADA does guarantee reasonable accommodations, but they have to be just that: reasonable. \n\nThis young woman is under 18yo, so legally she is in fact entitled to more breaks than an employee who is 18+, but here's the thing... if her shift is &lt;4hrs, in most states, the employee is not legally entitled to *any* breaks. That 1st break doesn't kick in until your shift is scheduled for 4 entire hours. For a 16yo, I would probably give one 10 min break every 2 hours (which is what a previous supervisor of mine did for a barista who was 16.)\n\nBeing paid to sit in the back and watch YouTube is *absolutely not* a reasonable accommodation, and would pretty much ensure that the rest of the staff resented her (and you).

And because I was up front with it, provided documentation, and never abused it (aka, tried to take the breaks when I didn't actually need it), no one ever had a problem. \n\nI'd set my watch for 5 minutes, and then take the time to get breathing under control, re-center, cry, whatever I needed... and then go back out and handle my business, because *I was being paid to do a job*.\n\nYes, I agree that school and education should come first... especially because she's under 18. But the ability to call off whenever she has \"significant\" homework, with zero parameters for what \"significant\" is or consequences is also not a reasonable accommodation. If working on school nights is a problem, then her availability should be weekends only. \n\n\"Give her lots of compliments\" reads like a parent who thinks their little darling is the specialist angel ever, and everyone needs to know it... if she cannot function without constant compliments, then she needs to work on that issue before entering the workforce, because that will not be the case.

I was a hotel manager and I was approached by a man who worked with special needs people who wanted to work jobs. He was interested in if I would hire a young girl, around 20, who was mentally around the age of a pre-teen due to a brain injury. Since a hotel has basic cleaning tasks, he thought it would be a good fit. He said that he would be in and out to keep up with her progress. Her mother was also involved in the process. At first, it worked well. She basically helped fold laundry, do minor cleaning tasks, and assist the executive housekeeper. But soon, things devolved rapidly. At times, she wouldn\u2019t want to do the tasks assigned to her. She\u2019d be found sleeping in the laundry room. She would get very irate when she didn\u2019t get her way. But what became worse was the guy who was supposed to be watching her. He would come in and go directly to the staff, instead of speaking with me like requested. He would berate the staff for not having her do harder tasks and ask all kinds of personal questions of them. He wanted her and my staff to do videos and photos of her working but wanted it to seem like she was cleaning an entire room alone. Finally the staff broke down and told me what was going on. While we all loved the girl and wished her the best, we had to let her go. While I understand that people with mental disabilities would like to have jobs, it is important that a) they are in jobs that play to their strengths, b) that the disability and special requirements are known prior to hiring to see if they can be accommodated, c) the person can be communicated with and if another party is involved, that this person is easy to contact and willing to work with the company instead of against it. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, an employee with a disability and a need of special requirements must tell the employer at the time of interview.

I am not the owner, but I have been with them since I was a teen and worked my way up to my current position. It\u2019s been the perfect job to pair with my classes. As the general manager, I do the scheduling as well as the hiring. The owners trust my judgment and let me hire/fire at my own discretion. \n\nLast week I hired a girl, 16, from the local highschool. She was extremely sweet and showed a willingness to work. Seems a little on the quiet side but this being her first job I think it\u2019s expected to an extent. There were zero tells/ mentions that she may be special needs. \n\n2 days after hiring her (she\u2019s not supposed to start until this upcoming week) her father came in and introduced himself to me. He was polite, and thanked me for hiring his daughter and left his phone number, telling me to call him after I\u2019m off. I was confused by this as I\u2019ve never dealt with a situation like this. But I did call him. \n\nHe thanked me again but then said his daughter has severe anxiety and a \u201cslow learner\u201d and that I need to make special accommodations for her. Here is what they are. \n\n- Do not schedule her for more than 3 hours at a time. \n\n- please allow her as many as she needs 10 minute breaks when she starts to appear overwhelmed. He said that if it is very busy, it is better to just let her sit in the back room and watch YouTube. \n\n- her school comes first (which I understand) but he said when she has \u201csignificant\u201d homework she will need to call off. \n\n- give her plenty of compliments and let the other staff know to go the extra mile to make her feel welcome. \n\n- if she does make a mistake, not to discuss it with her but to call him. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about employment law and not sure if I could be in legal trouble, but like every state we have at-will employment. I called the owner to tell him about this and he said to use my discretion. I want to call the father back and say I cannot make these accommodations, and if she does need these accommodations I will have to rescind the job offer. \n\nI feel for the girl, like I said she was very sweet. But at the same time I do have a business to run, I\u2019m not a special ed teacher. What is the point of hiring her when I will need to be over staffed to accommodate for her? I just can\u2019t do it. So right now I\u2019m thinking calling her dad tomorrow and letting him know that she will be treated like every other employee and if this won\u2019t work for her than she cannot work here.

So she has struggled. \nMy husband and I try to help her as much as we can- we aren\u2019t rich by any means but we both work so obviously having 2 incomes versus her one make us in a more privileged situation. \nMy husband is lucky enough that his employer gives him a new Iphone every year. He is able to buy his old phone at a reduced price- usually around 35% of what they go for in the second hand market. He got this year\u2019s phone a month ago. We have always given my friend his old phone which, as she has 3 teenage boys helps as she gives it to one of them. We never asked her for the money my husband paid for the phone, nor did we mention to her that we did have to pay anything for it, as far as she knew it was free to my husband. \nSo we give her the phone-( it was an IPhone 13 in case anyone cares). Unfortunately at some point the charging cable had gotten lost pr broken. As a quick aside my husband and I have 4 teenagers ourselves and they all have phones. For some reason most of the chargers in our house are broken so we now only have 2 chargers and 6 phones. \nMy friend asked where the charger was and I explained it was gone and we didn\u2019t currently have a spare. She got a bit annoyed asking if I just couldn\u2019t give her one of the 2 we have but I explained that we were constantly using them as we all needed to charge our phones. She asked again for one of the chargers and I said no, a bit more firmly. \nMy husband and I both work until 5 (get home about 6), something my friend is aware of. She came by the next day around 4 when only my younger 2 teens were home (F15 and F14). She told my daughters that I had said it was ok to take one of the two chargers we had and that they should get it for her- which they did as they had no reason to question her. \nI am now quite annoyed with my friend, mostly because I feel she came over when she knew I was out and took advantage of my daughters.

So she has struggled. \nMy husband and I try to help her as much as we can- we aren\u2019t rich by any means but we both work so obviously having 2 incomes versus her one make us in a more privileged situation. \nMy husband is lucky enough that his employer gives him a new Iphone every year. He is able to buy his old phone at a reduced price- usually around 35% of what they go for in the second hand market. He got this year\u2019s phone a month ago. We have always given my friend his old phone which, as she has 3 teenage boys helps as she gives it to one of them. We never asked her for the money my husband paid for the phone, nor did we mention to her that we did have to pay anything for it, as far as she knew it was free to my husband. \nSo we give her the phone-( it was an IPhone 13 in case anyone cares). Unfortunately at some point the charging cable had gotten lost pr broken. As a quick aside my husband and I have 4 teenagers ourselves and they all have phones. For some reason most of the chargers in our house are broken so we now only have 2 chargers and 6 phones. \nMy friend asked where the charger was and I explained it was gone and we didn\u2019t currently have a spare. She got a bit annoyed asking if I just couldn\u2019t give her one of the 2 we have but I explained that we were constantly using them as we all needed to charge our phones. She asked again for one of the chargers and I said no, a bit more firmly. \nMy husband and I both work until 5 (get home about 6), something my friend is aware of. She came by the next day around 4 when only my younger 2 teens were home (F15 and F14). She told my daughters that I had said it was ok to take one of the two chargers we had and that they should get it for her- which they did as they had no reason to question her. \nI am now quite annoyed with my friend, mostly because I feel she came over when she knew I was out and took advantage of my daughters. Am I being an as*hole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He started going off on my taste, how I wouldn\u2019t know good coffee if it hit me in the face, how I was crazy to drink that trash at various points throughout the day. Finally at lunch he was like \u201cyou should really just let me make you something so you can actually appreciate good coffee\u201d and like? We have a small kitchen where he keeps a moka pot and beans and it sounded unbearable. I said \u201cParker it is not normal to be this intense over a cup of coffee\u201d and a few of my coworkers who were sitting next to me snorted.

Finally at lunch he was like \u201cyou should really just let me make you something so you can actually appreciate good coffee\u201d and like? We have a small kitchen where he keeps a moka pot and beans and it sounded unbearable.

Fuel is not the cheapest and due to the winter conditions i like having a bigger car ( pajero consuming 10-11l/100km if diesel) when i brought up if we will Split cost  , she just started finding excuses that she has a low Pay , and that she had to use emergency credit card and take 700\u20ac overdraft because something happened in france and that she cant afford anything \nI was disappointed.\n\n She was here for a week, we payed her food , her fuel , she was staying at our place and I\u2019m now out of all money . I arranged here a drive with another guy to the airport for almost free and after a week she is gone. I talked to her about this 2 days ago , If she realizes we are trying to start our life.

I told her basically , that now it is all right , I explained that this was why I was acting weird and that it disappointed me. I told her I don\u2019t want any money as there is nothing it would solve right now . And that she absolutely shouldn\u2019t do this . I also asked her how she is traveling all these countries and she told me she is going with like 4-5 people in a car and are splitting fuel .Basically low cost ,  and she told me she spent only 120\u20ac in France (remember the 700\u20ac?) .\n\nShe left today and i got actually sick yesterday . I have fever and my throat is killing me . I had headaches the whole week she has been here . I probably had to remind myself that she really isnt going to change. i have a feeling she is using the people travelling with her for saving  money and them paying for her being too embarassed to ask for money back .

Not poor,not rich. My mum asked me a few months ago if she could come and visit us.  .We talked About it where we would go what we would see . She bought her airplane tickets. Never talked About money or anything , as i saw her being in france a few weeks ago , then in italy in Dolomites. She is a teacher , not making huge money , But i tought she has a side job for financing all these trips. She is certified trainer for kids and i know she was doing some training for figure skaters and etc. Anyway , she came here , and we had to take a drive to my town , which is 500km from the AirPort . So 1000km a day. Fuel is not the cheapest and due to the winter conditions i like having a bigger car ( pajero consuming 10-11l/100km if diesel) when i brought up if , she just started finding excuses that she has a low Pay , and that she had to use emergency credit card and take 700\u20ac overdraft because something happened in france and that she cant afford anything \nI was disappointed. She was here for a week, we payed her food , her fuel , she was staying at our place and I\u2019m now out of all money . I arranged here a drive with another guy to the airport for almost free and after a week she is gone. I talked to her about this 2 days ago , If she realizes we are trying to start our life. And that if you don\u2019t talk about money , money is not a problem . I know, I should have asked her if she has enough to be around her , and I didn\u2019t because I thought if money is problem for her , she would talk. She felt angry after I talked to her and she told me that she was hoping that when I invite her I would pay it all( I didn\u2019t invite her , she asked me if she can visit but I didn\u2019t oppose not to escalate it because I saw she isn\u2019t thinking she is in the wrong) she was mad and sad and tried to play the victim card and emotionally manipulate me  . I told her basically , that now it is all right , I explained that this was why I was acting weird and that it disappointed me. I told her I don\u2019t want any money as there is nothing it would solve right now . And that she absolutely shouldn\u2019t do this . I also asked her how she is traveling all these countries and she told me she is going with like 4-5 people in a car and are splitting fuel .Basically low cost ,  and she told me she spent only 120\u20ac in France (remember the 700\u20ac?)  . She left today and i got actually sick yesterday . I have fever and my throat is killing me . I had headaches the whole week she has been here . I probably had to remind myself that she really isnt going to change. i have a feeling she is using the people travelling with her for saving  money and them paying for her being too embarassed to ask for money back .

Hell, my Dad even told me when I was young Brenda would ask why I had to be born/even exist.\n\nWhen we grew up in primary school I tried to speak with her and she always treated me like garbage &amp; would joke about me in front of her friends, and would ignore me at home.\n \nIn secondary, I ended up going to an upper end school after performing well on an exam, and it only got worse. Sure, we had 1-2 in-jokes from the early school, but it was clear I was trying to foster a relationship that wasn't there, so I gave up. \n\nThere's only been tense moments since, usually her overblowing something out of proportion, then crying to dodge the blame. Note that my Mom always gives her better treatment/never blames her and rarely makes her take accountability, probably because Brenda views herself as the outsider despite us being raised the same, and her getting way more from my parents materially than me. She barely respects my Dad, spreading any arguments to neighbours, always begging him to buy dresses/clothes when she has no job, and when he declines she'll ask my Mom because my Mom will ask my Dad for 'money' which he'll give (lots to unpack there, but that's another story).\n\nAdditionally, there was a time she completely screwed my trust. My parents are major conspiracy theorists in general and are against vaccines, but I chose to get vaccinated. \n\nBut Brenda asked me about the process of getting the vaccine, making me think she was starting to form her own opinions. Then she went and told my parents I got jabbed, showing the screenshots of our texts, making me come up with a convoluted lie to defend myself on the spot. \n\nFast forward, I go to University after failing a year or two of sixth form and start doing really well.

The degree is in pre-school teaching.\n\nI have no respect for her because she's incapable of taking accountability and is clearly just mooching off my parents, has a history of demanding independence and yet relies on them every step of the way. She treats me like garbage so I don't want to go to her graduation and I certainly don't want her at mine.

She signs up after I tell my results to my parents, and relies on my Dad for help for almost everything throughout her degree - with him even telling me she's barely earned it, despite her somehow getting an ego and saying she \"should've got a 1st\" when she could barely form a sentence at the start. The degree is in pre-school teaching.\n\nI have no respect for her because she's incapable of taking accountability and is clearly just mooching off my parents, has a history of demanding independence and yet relies on them every step of the way. She treats me like garbage so I don't want to go to her graduation and I certainly don't want her at mine. My Dad says to do it because it'll be the last two events we do as a 'family' with my Masters being separate, but I don't want to see her face at my Bachelors. It's not my family's event, it's mine - even if I force myself to go to hers. WIBTA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I absolutely love my cat as do my kids. Well recently my best friend and her boyfriend broke up and she had no where to go so she came to stay with me. She has been to my house plenty of times and has told me she\u2019s allergic to my cat. When she asked to move in I told her yes but that I wanted her to keep in mind that she\u2019s allergic to my cat. She said she\u2019d keep her door closed and take allergy medicine. Well we are a month in with her living with me and she keeps hinting to me that I should take my cat to the shelter, I always laugh and tell her she\u2019s absolutely nuts. But last night she flipped on me and said if I cherish our friendship that I\u2019d do whatever I had to do to keep her comfortable in OUR home. I told her this is my cat, kids and I\u2019s home and if she had a problem she can leave. AITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They brag about this and treat it like it\u2019s hilarious and quirky. I go to bed between 8-9pm and wake up around 5:30-6am. When I come visit them, I am almost always exhausted by 11:30-midnight while they are trying to start movies and watch mindless YouTube videos until 2am. They usually get up when we have activities planned for a certain day, but we have been late before because their bed \u201cwas just too comfortable.\u201d \n\nToday is the day I leave for home. I told my friends I wanted to be leaving here before noon so I could drive the 5+ hours home and still have time to unpack, reset, and relax. I\u2019ve been up since 9am and it\u2019s now 11am. I am packed and ready to leave. I have not heard a peep from my friends. Despite telling them multiple times I wanted to be out of here before noon, they are still in bed asleep at 11am. They told me last night that they bought ingredients for pancakes and wanted to make me breakfast before I left. I don\u2019t even think they set an alarm for today. \n\nI have considered saying something to them over the years but they are nice enough to house and feed me when I come over so I don\u2019t want to make them think I\u2019m ungrateful or being rude. I am also autistic and prefer to stick to a schedule, especially when it comes to traveling home. I don\u2019t think my friends really understand my autism and how it affects things like this. \n\nI just find it inconsiderate that they consistently stay up late knowing they will sleep in and it throws a wrench into the plan I told them I had. They are very proud of being \u201claidback\u201d and \u201cgo with the flow\u201d people, and criticize others for being too \u201cuptight\u201d about plans and schedules. \n\nI am very agitated and upset by this behavior, but I\u2019ve been told I should give them grace and try to savor my time with them because they live so far away. \n\nAITAA?

I try to visit them a few times a year for 3-4 days at a time. I am on one of these visits as we speak.\n\nMy friends regularly stay up until 2-3am even on days they have to get up at 6am for work. They brag about this and treat it like it\u2019s hilarious and quirky. I go to bed between 8-9pm and wake up around 5:30-6am. When I come visit them, I am almost always exhausted by 11:30-midnight while they are trying to start movies and watch mindless YouTube videos until 2am. They usually get up when we have activities planned for a certain day, but we have been late before because their bed \u201cwas just too comfortable.\u201d \n\nToday is the day I leave for home. I told my friends I wanted to be leaving here before noon so I could drive the 5+ hours home and still have time to unpack, reset, and relax. I\u2019ve been up since 9am and it\u2019s now 11am. I am packed and ready to leave. I have not heard a peep from my friends. Despite telling them multiple times I wanted to be out of here before noon, they are still in bed asleep at 11am. They told me last night that they bought ingredients for pancakes and wanted to make me breakfast before I left. I don\u2019t even think they set an alarm for today. \n\nI have considered saying something to them over the years but they are nice enough to house and feed me when I come over so I don\u2019t want to make them think I\u2019m ungrateful or being rude. I am also autistic and prefer to stick to a schedule, especially when it comes to traveling home. I don\u2019t think my friends really understand my autism and how it affects things like this. \n\nI just find it inconsiderate that they consistently stay up late knowing they will sleep in and it throws a wrench into the plan I told them I had. They are very proud of being \u201claidback\u201d and \u201cgo with the flow\u201d people, and criticize others for being too \u201cuptight\u201d about plans and schedules. \n\nI am very agitated and upset by this behavior, but I\u2019ve been told I should give them grace and try to savor my time with them because they live so far away. \n\nAITAA?

I found my old iPhone 6s and decided to sell it. The phone was in perfect condition, 16gb, no scratches and the battery was also in a good condition for the time of use (85%) I also offered an original Apple phone case. I searched and the price range for a iPhone6s here in my country and it was around 40\u20ac-60\u20ac depending on the conditions. I posted it on Facebook marketplace for 60\u20ac, one lady called me and asked me if I could do it for 50\u20ac because i didn\u2019t had a charger. I agreed and in the next day I met her and gave her the phone, she checked the it and everything was working fine, she gave me the money and I told her that if she needed any help with it to just send me a message. Now keep in mind that the iPhone 6 is an old phone and some apps are kinda limited because some updates aren\u2019t supported but it\u2019s still usable if you just want a phone just to do simple activities.

I found my old iPhone 6s and decided to sell it. The phone was in perfect condition, 16gb, no scratches and the battery was also in a good condition for the time of use (85%) I also offered an original Apple phone case. I searched and the price range for a iPhone6s here in my country and it was around 40\u20ac-60\u20ac depending on the conditions. I posted it on Facebook marketplace for 60\u20ac, one lady called me and asked me if I could do it for 50\u20ac because i didn\u2019t had a charger. I agreed and in the next day I met her and gave her the phone, she checked the it and everything was working fine, she gave me the money and I told her that if she needed any help with it to just send me a message. Now keep in mind that the iPhone 6 is an old phone and some apps are kinda limited because some updates aren\u2019t supported but it\u2019s still usable if you just want a phone just to do simple activities. Fast forward to today she sent me an audio cursing me out because the phone \u201cdoesn\u2019t work and doesn\u2019t turn on\u201d and I was very confused because the phone worked just fine when I gave it to her.

{"post": {"title": "AITA For getting on the bus and leaving my friend to walk.", "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "selftext": "(All Names are fake) \n\nI am a 14 Yr old girl. So is my friend Isla. Isla lives in an apartment with her dad Ryan and her sister Amy. Since we've been friends I have been paying for all the things that she wants. Starbucks, food, toys, bus tickets, train tickets, JustEat, snacks, chocolate, mcdonalds and more. I've spent more than \u00a3600 on her so far, she never says thank you or pays for anything I ask for. I've been a pushover. We recently went into a shop, I got my snacks for \u00a34.37 and then Isla got hers, she placed them on the counter, the cashier read out \u00a37.85 and she turned around, just stared at me. I asked \"what is it?\" And she responded \"Aren't you paying?\" I lost it and stormed out the shop. \n\nAround 3 days later she invited me out with her, I said yes because I had nothing better to do. We met at her house and agreed we would take the bus to a town close by. We walked to the bus stop and waited for it. When it arrived a few people got off and we got on, its \u00a31.50 for a ticket there. Isla paid 30p and I paid the other \u00a32.70 , I was surprised she even paid for any of it. After we arrived we got off and walked around, as per usual Isla brought around 50p - \u00a31 and made me pay for her food.\n\n I was so mad that I barely spoke to her while we were there. She even ate most of my food with the reasoning  \"Oh c'mon, you've eaten enough right?\" I rolled my eyes whilst WITHOUT PERMISSION she started grabbing the food out my hands. We walked back to the bus stop, noone else was there so we just waited again. Once it arrived, a few people got off. Isla got on first and then I stepped on, it was a double-decker so she started walking towards the stairs without even asking me to pay. I wigged out completely. Who did she think she was? \n\nI asked the bus driver for 1 bus ticket, I paid and called Isla back down. \"Yeah, what is it?\" She asked. I told her to come towards me for a second and said \"You can't get on without a ticket, right?\" She looked at me confused. \"What do you mean? You have enough.\" \nI rolled my eyes and said \" I have enough. But you don't so get off.\" She opened her mouth to say something when the bus driver said \"your friend's right, either pay for yourself or get off.\" Isla rolled her eyes and walked out. She stood facing the bus doorway and told me I was being greedy and unreasonable. \n\nI chuckled while she tried to guilt me into paying for her. The doors then closed and she put the bird up. I smiled and waved as the bus drove away. I haven't spoken to her in a week. It felt powerfull to stand up to her like that but I can't help wondering, AITA?\n\nBTW We both live in an extremely close-cut town. Everyone knows everyone kinda thing, it would take her under 10 minutes to walk home and her older sister could pick her up if need be, she had her phone with her and I saw her the next day walking down the street so I know she's fine.

Not in a sexual sense at all, obviously, but in the sense that she is basically switching your roles as parent and kid. She is lonely and missing your dad, and she is making it your responsibility to make her feel better and comfort her. But you're the kid, not her parent.

I shouldn't be in charge of making you feel less lonely. You're supposed to be the grownup, and it's not my job to take care of you when you're unhappy or nervous. It's not fair to put that on me.

For sure, this is very bad behavior from your son, and you should 100% call out the behavior. But saying his late mother would be disappointed at him is kind of attacking his identity and self worth - it's a massive low blow to a person who is still grieving. Rule no 1 when dealing with grieving people is to decouple bad behavior from the person's identity. If you are going to be critical, criticize the behavior, not the person. \n\nYou know your son better than Reddit does, you knew him for 20 something years before he lost his mom, so ask yourself this: Could you imagine him saying this to any person before his mother died? If the answer is no, then this is related to his grief for his lost mother. \n\nYou've obviously processed your grief and have started to move on, which is completely natural and definitely not something to feel guilty or ashamed about. But your son clearly hasn't, and even though his behavior is completely out of line, you need to be compassionate and patient. The WORST thing you could do is make him believe his mother would be ashamed of him, if you convince him of this it could trigger some very negative self perception which can lead to spiraling behavior. You need to gently guide your son towards acceptance and encourage him to move on. If I were you I would use an apology for your comments to try and open up a dialogue with your son. Reassure your son that you miss his mother and you're not trying to replace her... but you feel ready to move on. Remind him that your current girlfriend has done nothing wrong and doesn't deserve to be spoken to like that ... but there are no hard feelings for when he's ready to meet her assure him things will be ok. It is completely likely he will react badly, perhaps he will say things to aggravate you, and when he does you need to stay calm. \n\nWhen you are about to talk to him, prime yourself with these thoughts so that you have a compassionate mindset: this is your son, you are his only remaining parent. When he lost his mother, he lost a relationship that is IRREPLACEABLE. Whereas you can move on and remarry - he will never get a new mother, and this resentment is probably one of the sources of his negative feelings. \n\nIt's also worth considering what's at stake for you as well. To be frank, you could lose your relationship with your son. Also, if your son slips into a deep depression, will you regret not being more compassionate and supportive? Something tells me this isn't sitting right with you, why else would you seek reassurance from Reddit. Even though it's hard, control your emotions and be the father your son needs right now. \n\nGood luck, I sincerely hope you and your son can work through this.

I offered to host since my parents are away and they let me have people over.\n\nWe made a group chat to plan with about 5 of us. We decided people could stay over so we could drink without needing to worry about driving home. \nOne friend said they couldn't stay the night since they had to be dogsit the family dogs. One of the other guys (also a dog owner) said 'just bring them with you'. I'm not sure if he was joking or just being stupid and I didn't think anything of it.\n\nFast forward to this evening, he turns up with the dogs.

I offered to host since my parents are away and they let me have people over.\n\nWe made a group chat to plan with about 5 of us. We decided people could stay over so we could drink without needing to worry about driving home. \nOne friend said they couldn't stay the night since they had to be dogsit the family dogs. One of the other guys (also a dog owner) said 'just bring them with you'. I'm not sure if he was joking or just being stupid and I didn't think anything of it.\n\nFast forward to this evening, he turns up with the dogs. I was shocked but didn't say anything in the group setting. Everyone else loves dogs and were petting them and nobody said anything. I was half hoping a friend would speak up.\n\nHere's the thing. This kid is the nicest guy, he's a good friend and really kind. He's just oblivious when it comes to his dogs. His house is covered in hair (they're golden retrievers) and smells like a wet dog. I really didn't want to be mad at him but I also know my parents wouldnt like dogs in the home.\n\nThe dogs immediately jumped onto the couch and I asked him if he they could not. He told them to get off, but when the game started another friend beckoned to one of them to get up on the couch. \n\nI told my friend that he was being disrespectful to me, but he just told me it was fine and brushed it off. All of my friends agreed with him and said the dogs weren't doing dny harm. I was mad at that point but tried to restrain myself.\n\nAIta for being mad at him?\n\nAlso, it's been 6 hours and he hasn't let the dogs out. I'm a bit worried they may have relieved themselves inside...especially since I've seen them mark pot plants at my friends house. Is 6 hours viable to hold it?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"post": {"title": "Do you still root your phone?", "subreddit": "Android", "selftext": "Does anyone still root their phones? A rhetorical question as I'm sure plenty do, but are you not afraid of the compromised security? I get that it gives you full control of the OS, the bootloader etc, so you can really customize your phone to do anything - for example I can't record phone calls on my phone anymore, I'm sure it's a breeze if rooted, you can also probably spoof the GPS easily without other apps knowing, but overall these are very minor things, and I would never consider it because the phone is my authenticator for everything - it acts like a hardware SecureKey for my bank, all my credit cards, Steam account, other important sites use it as 2 factor auth. To get any benefit from root (afaik) I would have to flash a different ROM on it, which could really do anything to your phone, it can be capturing and forwarding your biometrics, your passwords etc. Is that not so?

I live in a, historical pretty samsung - focused country, if we talk about android/ios market share. 3-4 years ago, you would see every kind of phone.\n\nNow, thats changed. Premium androids are few and fare between. Once I a while I do spot a s23 ultra or base s21, but otherwise? \n\nEverything is an iphone. \n\nLike if you talk about younger people, like its almost exclusively iphone. But even in elderly people, it's really common too. I own a s21 ultra and I NEVER saw a single person with the same phone as me.\n\nAnd now again, with the release of the iPhone 15, everyone is talking about it, like every year.

I read something like that everywhere.\n\nBut what about android? Where are the iphone people talking about switching to the latest Samsung or pixel phones?\n\nYeah, that doesn't happen, because there is not a lot to add to android. It's the free phone.

It's weird how so many people in the US are so obsessed with getting the newest iPhone every year. Fundamentally, smart phones haven't really changed much, but Apple's marketing is very good.\n\nOutside of the US's high iphone market share, it's worth mentioning that android is more segmented down. I know a lot of people on Samsungs, but there's Pixel and OnePlus and all the much smaller names, which does create brand dilution. Companies like Nintendo and Disney are asses about their branding for a good reason.\n\nImo, android phones tend to always use new tech before it's ready (e.g. folding). I could see Apple eventually releasing a foldable once all the kinks get worked out which is why they always do feel more polished. Though, I've been seeing a lot of people roaming around with foldables these days. Another big thing that cripples android is the lack of a good SoC setup like Apple's.

Imo, a lot of the issues of android is that the stack is not under complete control of one party, so it needs to support so many different possible hardware configurations and interests. There's too many chefs in the kitchen. Google does dumb stuff and would rather have other oems make phones to deal with customer support and all that. However, I think Apple's largest advantage is they're in control of the entire hardware/software stack with only a few configurations to worry about and able to optimize from the chip to driver to OS to apps.

This is an abysmal decision on Samsungs side, not only because they're removing something that has been heavily advertised as a huge part of this flagship but also it's usefulness.\n\nApparently they will adopt 50MP 1/2.52\" 3x and 5x sensor which would In theory provide somewhat constant high quality zoom from up until 8x by using the high mega pixel sensor crop. This is most likely done due to cost cutting and desire to compete with their competitors who are also adopting the 5x zoom lens. \n\nI think this is a big mistake, although it sounds nice to have high quality pics from 1 to 8x ish zoom with some  gaps inbetween, I rarely thought to myself \"Damn I wish I had 7x optical right now\" It's almost exclusively 0.6x 1x 3x and something far in the distance for 10x+. I can think of a couple of ocassions where a 5x would have been good to have but they are definitely the most rare of the bunch.

And no, I'm not going with a Mac.\n\nSo, I decided to sell my few months old iPhone 12 and get a comparable Android. After doing research, the final choice was for a second-hand but mint Samsung S21FE (which was cheaper than what I got for my significantly scratched iPhone 12...), which I generally enjoy very much. It:\n\na) is actually better looking design-wise IMHO, the material doesn't really feel inferior  \nb) has a gorgeous display with 120 Hz (this is a bigger thing than I expected it to be) and the nominally lower PPI isn't even showing for some reason; it looks just as crisp, even though I am very sensitive to resolutions  \nc) has a better OS \u2013 the Android system is just simply better with stuff like procedures *^((automated connecting to my BT set in response to launching the YouTube Music app - I'd never been able to achieve that with iOS))* and customizability *^((I have an app that allows me to turn on the flashlight by holding the power button \u2013 how cool is that))**.* Also, the return button makes a major difference for comfortable navigating.\n\nBut there's one thing: the damn phone unlocking in Android. I just can't get it right, no matter what. The fingerprint reader sucks, the wannabe face recognition sucks, pattern lock is basically the only usable thing, but I'm not a troglodyte to be using tech solutions from 2010. Also, and this is especially disappointing: Smart Lock sucks as well, because it doesn't work in 30% of cases, for some bloody reason. Against all this mess, Apple FaceID seems a godsend.\n\nSo, long story short \u2013 if some Chinese manage to steal FaceID from Apple, get away with it and manage to market it in Europe one way or another, I'm set. Apple can frankly go bankrupt for all I care.\n\nThank you.

That's at least how it's supposed to work. \n\nNow, how this actually works (at least to my experience) is that Android keeps track of the app where you last interacted. Let's say you are on Instagram and you just closed your notes. You could swipe left to access the notes and maybe write something, like for example paste a link of a video you want to save for later idk. If you now try to swipe right to go back to Instagram, well you are out of luck because since you actually interacted with the notes, that's your most recent app which means that it got moved on top of the stack, so to go back to Instagram you would have to swipe left (cause it became the second most recent app). \n\nIf this was consistent, it wouldn't be that much of a problem, you could just get used to the behaviour. Unfortunately it isn't. \n\nTurns out that some apps, like the settings app, can somehow have multiple instances of themselves on the stack. Try, for example, to check both for Google Play Systen updates and OS update, if you then try to swipe left and right you will notice that you will see both the screens for the updates and the settings app as three different \"apps\" in your stack, so you will need 3 swipes instead of one to go past them. \nAlso, some apps count like \"interaction\" with them just visualizing them (I believe at least), this means that the app you just swiped from gets instantly put second in the stack and when you go for the second swipe...you just go back to the app you started from.\n\nThis can repeat again and again, so if the app you are trying to reach is not the very last one you used before the one you are currently on, you can just forget it because it will be such a pain that eventually you either swipe upwards and scroll manually to the app or just go back to the launcher and look for the app yourself. \n\nSo, am I the only one that has a problem with this?

And then how to manage that among other possible orders of apps that may be navigated to later?\n\n&gt;Turns out that some apps, like the settings app, can somehow have multiple instances of themselves on the stack. Try, for example, to check both for Google Play Systen updates and OS update, if you then try to swipe left and right you will notice that you will see both the screens for the updates and the settings app as three different \"apps\" in your stack, so you will need 3 swipes instead of one to go past them.

Recents can have activity-based or task-based instances in recents.

Today you have a phone UI and a tablet UI that's not desktop friendly. This new desktop UI will be a third variant of Android that will be alongside the phone and tablet variants. It will be available on ARM 2 in 1 detachables and every other Android device including phones and slates when the device is plugged in to a TV or monitor. The Android Wear and TV are separate operating systems unlike the three variants in one OS.\n\nIt's up to the OEM of the device to determine if the tablet device deserves the mobile tablet UI of right now or the upcoming desktop UI. The device needs to be in tablet DPI and then they activate the desktop UI by declaring their device type as PC in the Android Manifest which needs root to edit if not done by an OEM. Google will tell the OEM if they need to do this or not depending on the tablets form factor and if they refuse then Google will invalidate their Google Play Services license for that device. If you have a 2 in 1 ARM detachable tablet you'll have the desktop UI and if you have a standalone slate tablet you'll have the non desktop tablet UI. If the tablet has a keyboard cover touchpad that can connect without wireless or USB then it's considered a 2 in 1 and if it doesn't then it's considered a standalone slate.\n\nThere is no mode activated by switch or automatically if a mouse is detected or not. In Android desktop variant, just like Windows 11, all apps open in floating windows whether the device has a mouse connected or not. Also the tablet variant doesn't change into desktop mode by plugging in with a mouse. I believe ChromeOS will depricate the tablet mode by combining floating windows and floating taskbar but the final desktop UI will be more like Android when the two modes combine. Windows 12 will also introduce floating taskbar with status bar.\n\nDespite Google making competing operating systems on ARM detachables (it will be the OEMs choice if they want Android Desktop or ChromeOS), there will be advantages to using ChromeOS instead of Android including:\n\n-The ability to have as many active apps and opened apps as you want. Android is limited to 5 active apps and 15 screenshotted apps.\n-Android desktop mode has no minimize, only close and to clear the app instead of just closing it it also has to be closed out from overview/recents.

Apple aren't using predatory pricing to undercut Android phones pricing, get all the customers, then will skyrocket the prices in the long term.

In fact, it's way fucking better; and I feel like people tend to not want to dig into the world of Android because they are \"scared\" into thinking that Android is \"hard to use\". But it really isn't. Or perhaps the common misconception that an Android phone has a hardcore malware vibe to it. I think people are not willing to try out things, I get that some people do not know the power of Android (which I will be explaining now) but the people who are told that power (and I have done so myself) still don't have the balls to go and try it out. Even when explaining the benefits. The HUGE benefits. \n\nAnd so this Android \"review\" won't be another (in my opinion) stupid and useless combat review between iPhone and Android, as those videos tend to leave out the again so called \"harder\" aspects of Android (even though those \"harder\" aspects of Android take seconds to a minute to learn, and trust me, it's well worth it).\n\nSo here it begins, where I will now explain to you the features that no big YouTuber or influencer has ever told YOU, about Android.\n\n1. Apps (more than one app/play store. With android, you can have tons of other apps, and open source apps (apps where their code is public, so they are safe 100 percent of the time if downloaded from reliable sources such as F Droid). I do want to emphasize that the malware aspect of Android tends to be spread as a rumor that nobody goes in depth on, but now is the time to go in depth folks because I am tired of the bullshit. Android malware is solely spread by the user tending to be a fool. Yes, Android comes with side loading (or the process of installing apps for Unknown sources (unkown sources = not from Google play)). You have to know what is appropriate or not. Don't get lured into things such as Modded APK's or sketchy websites. Don't abuse your power as an Android user, and then blame it on the Android. \n\nThe recently released ReVanced project allows you to crack certain apps (such as YouTube) in order to gain access to no ads, background play, customization, customization, customization, customization.\n\n2. Customization. I know this comes up a lot when talking about Android. And you might be sick of Android users saying customization is superb in Android without explaining it, as you may have no idea what they are talking about. But, let me explain. Since Android is Linux but made specifically for phones, you can literally do whatever you want: \n\nDownload custom launchers (such as an IOS launcher, a minimal launcher, a shortcut launcher, etc). These change your home screen and it's appearance, and provide you with specific features. \n\nCreate custom themed icons through apps such as Shortcut launcher. Yes, the latest and more recent versions of Android intruduced MaterialU, a system where the icon colors of your apps change according to your wallpaper. Pretty cool. But you can change these things with more advanced apps, such as Repainter. The possibilities of the color engine are quite limitless.\n\nCustomization of quick tiles provides you with the ability to add quick tiles (or a sort of \"widget\" tile) to your quick settings panel (on Android, it replaces the control center on iPhone). By adding your own quick tiles, you can easily and quickly access app-specific or device-specific functions in a breeze without having to 1. Search an app, 2. explore it to the bone, and 3. find what you are looking for after a minute.\n\nAnd there is much more. But for advanced users. I know I said this would not be like any other \"review\" and would cover the more advanced things, but things like rooting and loading custom ROMS on Android devices are subject to some people (I have rooted, and am now running a custom ROM, and it gets pretty insane as to what the abilities are). The things I listed before are I feel like already \"in depth\" for those who knows nothing about the true powers of Android.\n\n\n3. Ads. Ads can be removed on Android. By using a VPN, or an app such as AdAway (open source). A lot of people don't know this. But these VPN ad removers for apps are more for general ads, not ads for YouTube or Spotify. But, here is where ReVanced comes in. This project was recently released, and allows you to patch YouTube to have no ads, have background playback, and add tons of other features. XManager  allows you to manage modified Spotify apps, that unlock premium for you (downloads are not available). All these apps are open source and safe.\n\n4. Files. A lot of iPhone users tend to think their shitty iCloud system is an actual file system. But it really isn't. On Android, you can zip, unzip, move, load USB sticks, edit files, sync files through FTP, manage files through a terminal emulated such as Termux, create folders, create files, edit APK's (Android apps), run python files, run c++ files, run java files, etc. etc. etc.\n\nNow of course, the average user might not to use files, as this is solely beneficial for developers like myself. But trust me, the android file operating system is a dream compared to the unusable file system of iOS and even iPad OS. \n\n\nThere is much more to the Android world. Hell, I said this would be in depth but this description would be longer than a football field if I decided to go on. And my point is. Don't get fooled by what others say. Never judge a book by its cover. Take risks in life. It pays off. And why the hell am I saying this in a Reddit post about Android? Because simply put, you won't regret getting an Android for even one moment as soon as you learn, and learn about the benefits that will make you enjoy your life. \n\nTLDR: Just read, don't be lazy :&gt;)", "ups": 3, "depth": 0, "author": "ZioZvevo", "replies": [{"selftext": "Most people that I met who are into iPhones is because they can't tell one setting icon from another.

There are less than five full days left to resolve this problem, all used up by incorrect answers from Google, and it doesn't seem they are going to respond in a timely fashion with a concrete solution and aren't going to prolong the time, for which was asked already.\n\nStating that the app is collecting and sharing email addresses feels very wrong, and will most likely result in more than a few bad reviews. Apart from being rather frustrating, it will in the end affect the visibility of the app, and eventually lead to an end of the project as well.\n\nSome people suggested continuing with the GitHub release only. This isn't a solution, given that 99.8% (actual figure) of the user base of the app would be lost. I don't see people converting en masse to the GitHub version, either.\n\nI'm generally fine with the Play Store policies, which on paper seem reasonable, but the enforcement process and the communication with developers is more than a bit frustrating. It is not the first time I have to deal with this, and every time it is problematic. It is good that Google checks apps, but if something is found that isn't correct, it should be described accurately, including the why, how, where, when, etc. If a developer has questions, they should be answered, to the point. Developers shouldn't go trying to solve the issue, even with workarounds (been there, done that), but know what the issue is exactly, so it can be solved for what it is. Google says it is happy to work with developers, but sorry, I don't see that. Giving the same answer twice while time is passing is not working with developers.\n\nI've been considering ticking every box in the data safety form. The app will kill your cat, steal your grandma, hoping it is so ridiculous that everybody understands that it is incorrect, but I'm afraid there is too large a group of people not understanding this.\n\nI've been considering terminating the project, but that's not fair to the existing users.\n\nSo, what can I do?", "ups": 314, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/15y7g70/google_is_going_to_remove_netguard_from_the_play/", "num_comments": 129}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Google accusing other people of something that they notoriously do.", "ups": 62, "depth": 0, "author": "Huge_Agent_1448", "replies": [{"selftext": "fr", "ups": 6, "depth": 1, "author": "dryicecube90", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "SD Maid dev suffered the same.

{"post": {"title": "Android phone companies should charge a fee to bring your old phone up to date after 3 years. It's not as good as Apples solution, but with how fragmented Android is, it's probably the best option forward.", "subreddit": "Android", "selftext": "TLDR: benefits include better environmental impact, less depreciation, options to use an older phone that fits your needs better than a current phone could, and there is no current limit for modern phones to be limited on software, it's entirely limited to get you to upgrade. Also, this way you can choose if you want to upgrade your software experience, or keep the current Android version and only install security patches at a cheaper cost.\n\nSay you have a phone. You really like it, but it's getting old. Everything works well and it's still in good condition, and has all the features you want. However, it's out of date and vulnerable to attacks, and doesn't get the latest software.\n\nModern phones are so good that even a phone from 5 years ago like the galaxy s10 are still working brilliantly and really that much slower for daily use than modern devices. So due to software alone, the devices life span is limited, and depreciation is more significant. For example, look at used Samsung devices vs apple,  Apple always sells for more because their software keeps them going for much longer. \n\nSince it isn't economically logical to continue supporting phones that are out of date for free the way it was for the past 3 years of updates, charging a fee to keep these devices safe and functional will be a way companies can make extra profit from phones that are already sold, and let's people have more freedom with what phone they get. Of course it's preferable for them to buy a new phone. But at this point, phones are becoming more durable, faster, with longer battery life, better cameras, and even repairability is becoming a larger concern for Samsung and Apple. So being able to keep these phones around after their free update cycle is over apple be beneficial for pretty much everyone. Even resale value will increase because of the ability to safely use the device with the latest features. \n\nAnother point before closing this off, when you read the terms and conditions, you only own the device, the company owns the software. And when companies tie other components with the software for that specific device, they can do that because they own the software, but we're being let to use it. This can stop be worked around with paid software since they charge you a fee to use their software, so they still own and contain all rights to the software, but you paid for that access vs it just coming on your phone. \n\nLet me know what you think about this. This could be a huge step in the right direction for longevity of devices, improving resale value, and removing the requirement to buy a new phone every year. This does however make things slightly more difficult for companies. If they are competing against their old devices with new software, they need to give people a reason to upgrade since paying a small fee will allow them to continue using the device they currently have with all the latest software features. \n\nSo my thought on this is Android either has to adopt a strategy like Apple, which is what Google is trying to do, or charge for updates after free support runs out after 3 years. Because supporting your phones for 6-7 years without being apple and having almost complete control over the internal structure is, i imagine, expensive and difficult. Especially with the variety of Android phones vs iPhone which is much more integrated.", "ups": 0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/15zbzmk/android_phone_companies_should_charge_a_fee_to/", "num_comments": 48}, "replies": [{"selftext": "People don't update when its free", "ups": 32, "depth": 0, "author": "BcuzRacecar", "replies": [{"selftext": "What do you mean?

This got a little long, I guess I'm pretty passionate about it. These are specific use cases for me. I have a love/hate relationship with iPhone and actually appreciate many things about it, recommend it for relatives, etc. as it's great for many users. However for me, for the things I do, it's just not the best option.\r  \n\r  \nFrom the dev side: the iOS programming interfaces with hardware are crippled in the name of security. If I want to interact with a Bluetooth device, I have to do it in a way that Apple dictates, not the industry standard way. This complicates the user experience for third party apps. If I want to scan for wifi networks and present the list to a user for configuring a remote device, I can't. If I want to run a service in the background, good luck. I can't ask the user or Apple to keep something running in the background. I can try, but there's no guarantee it'll be stable. To maintain battery life, the OS is overly strict on what can and can't happen. I believe Apple cuts cost in hardware design by overly optimizing for battery life on the software side. This is a valid design choice, but not one that benefits the users IMO, especially when your hardware is still the most expensive on the market.\r  \n\r  \nFrom the consumer side: Everything is tightly locked down. If I want to sideload apps, maybe an open source alternative video player, I have to jailbreak the phone. Fine. But because of the way Apple has approached this (i.e. fight it tooth and nail), there is no safe/right way to do it, so consumers must seek out seedy communities where these processes are documented. This, combined with the dev issues above, reduce competition in the AppStore that solve certain tasks, so iOS app prices are hugely inflated. I promise you, Java/Kotlin is just as easy to write software in as Objective-C/Swift. The reason iOS apps are on average more than 2x the cost of their counterpart Android apps is because of these complications, not because the code is complex or unique. If I want a trusted file manager that can access the file system so that I can move files between applications, move pictures around, etc., email downloads from the browser, I can't or it's extremely limited because of sandboxing.\r  \n\r  \nAnother point I'm upset with Apple for is how they lock users into their ecosystem. Samsung, Google, and others are not innocent in this regard, but to some extent the underlying Android OS requires them to be more open. Apple having complete control over iOS and all phones that run it means they push the limits. I'll put it this way - I've personally switched between Android and iOS multiple times, and iOS to Android is always more difficult than Android to iOS. Even following Apple's documented processes for switching, the process is complicated (and I believe it's designed that way). A good example is iMessage - good luck receiving SMS from an iOS user for the days/weeks after switching. \"But you can unregister your phone number from iMessage..\" - yes. Does that change always make it to all users phones? No. Does Apple have a self service page dedicated to this problem? Yes. Does it always work.... no. Try explaining to your grandma why you're not responding, why she has to delete our previous conversation, recreate it, etc.\r  \n\r  \nTo play devils advocate - all of these things I've listed make for a secure device. Apple's reasoning for restricting many features is security. I truly understand the sentiment in many cases. Corporations need to be able to depend on the device. Many users are not technical. It makes sense to have security.\r  \n\r  \nTo that point however, Android faces the same requirements from the market, but handles it in a way that still allows users to have freedom of choice in most/all of these cases. Freedom to use the phone as the computer it is, not as a locked down piece of property. If I want to \"jailbreak\" my Android, I just check a box in the settings and restart the phone. If I want to sideload an app not available in the Play Store, I check a box and install it. If I want a file manager that can access everything, I give it that permission.\r  \n\r  \nBusinesses have the same security measures and access control features available on Android as the do on iOS. If they don't want their users to be able to do these things on Android, they can restrict it.", "ups": 3, "depth": 2, "author": "stanley_fatmax", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "I have been using Pixel since the Pixel2 series.

{"post": {"title": "My recent switch to the Google Pixel 7a will have you shocked...", "subreddit": "Android", "selftext": "Hi guys! I'm writing this in hopes of reaching people like me who were scouring reddit in hopes of making an informed decision between two android flagships after leaving apple 6 months ago.\n\nTD;LR: Left Apple after 10 years in February 2023. My last apple phone was a iPhone 12 Pro max. Went for the Samsung Z-Flip 4, which in so many ways I absolutely loved. Ended up with 2 defective devices and two different warranty devices in a 6 month span and decided to try some other android flagships.\n\nFor context, I grew up on Androids. I was somewhat late to the game in joining apple fandom 10 years ago. I had a Samsung S3 back then and sprung for the iPhone 4S at it's release.\n\nFast forward 10 years, upgrading my apple device every year until my last apple purchase of the 12 Pro max in January 2021. Ever since I would say about 2017 I was feeling a real lack of innovation for the average user on apples part. Pretty much after the X came out, that was the last apple device I was excited for and felt was an actual upgrade from what I had previously. Of course a new chip and camera specs all look amazing on paper, but in daily life use I was just not seeing the effect. Also note to mention, at this point I was completely immersed in Apple's ecosystem. The watch, a Mac book, Car play, Airpods. I was ready to leave it all behind and jump back to Android.\n\nI have to tell you I fell IN LOVE with the Z-Flip 4! I was so marveled by the nostalgia of the flipping mechanism being a 90s girl and closing my phone shut angrily as I did when I was a teen. I also was so impressed with how far Android's software and also Samsungs OS had come since I had left to be with apple.\n\nWith the defective issue I had with the Flip, first at the 3 month mark and then on the warranty device the 2 month mark, I had bubbling in the screen at the hinge. To the point where when I did apprehensively flip the device closed, the device started making a crunching noise. When this happened twice in a six month span, I was so disappointed.\n\nI was left with so many mixed feelings. I was loving my experience back with Android and was not interested in moving back to Apple. Now was time to hunt for another Android device that would suit my needs.\n\nI spoke to an agent with my mobile carrier while at work and frantically chose a Pixel 7a without doing any prior research. The price point was attractive to me and the deals my carrier were offering sounded great. I placed the order and anxiously awaited the Pixel to come in the mail.\n\nA few hours later on my ride home from work, my Z flip display completely dies. I panicked realizing my new phone would not be here for a few days (it was a Friday and pixel wasnt due to arrive until Tuesday) so I decided to go to a store and pick up a phone instead since I needed one immediately. I cancelled my order that was being shipped from the carrier and headed to the store minutes before closing.\n\nOn my grueling commute home, I began thinking, was I making the right choice with the  Pixel? After all, I just recently returned to Android and in the short time had become very accoustom to Samsungs One UI. In a snap decision, I decided after canceling the pixel order I would grab an S22 from the store instead. I hadn't used stock android in 13 or so years and I was enjoying Samsung One UI. I thought I was making the best decision I could. (Foreshadowing, this was not the right decision)\n\nI purchase the S22. I get home with it and I am extremely underwhelmed. I'm thinking the flip has ruined me for your traditional slab phone. I'm feeling super super defeated at this point. But I've spent so much money now I tell myself this is it for a while. I watched a lot of comparison videos for the S22/23 to the Pixel 7a and felt like I would be losing features and that I wasn't missing out on anything (Spoiler alert: I realize now these videos were so biased and the Pixel did not get the credit it deserves in ANY of these videos)\n\nI have the S22 for a few days, and I am constantly charging it. I know with androids the adaptive battery can take a few weeks to get to know your usage and all that. This still extremely pissed me off because this is a flagship phone, $1000 dollars a year and a half ago and my Z flip the non flagship did not have this issue. I'm honestly miserable at this point.\n\nTuesday rolls around and there's a package at my door. Despite cancelling my order for it before it had even shipped out, it has made its trip all the way to me. Some higher being or power or the universe wanted this device to reach me.\n\nI'm so unhappy at this point I figure, What the heck! I'm gonna pop my sim card in here and see what the experience is like. Morbid curiosity to see if this budget model Google phone is as bad as all the reviews say.\n\nI AM SO HAPPY I DID IT.\n\nThis is by far the cleanest software experience I've ever had besides Apple.\n\nThe features on this device are incredible. Googles call screening service, RCS messaging, the Google Lens, Google translate popping up in a message with a co worker who texts me in her native language. I am absolutely floored.\n\nHolding the device it feels so premium- not like a budget phone at all. The screen is a dream and I am loving every moment with this phone. I feel like Google is doing all the things with technology that all the major stakeholders in the phone arena are not doing.\n\nHaving an entire conversation in Spanish which is not my native language to be PROMPTED to be translated to English and I can toggle between- mind-blowing.\n\nI got my first spam call today and to use the call screening service was so satisfying and like the ultimate F-U button. They hung up halfway through the message.\n\nUsing the camera and the lens feature to identify this beautiful handbag someone was carrying that I loved and to be able to purchase it.\n\nThe battery life on this device is also incredible. Even with only having it a few days and adaptive battery still learning my usage patterns, my phone made it 15 hours and close to 7 hrs screen on time before I plugged it in at 8 percent tonight. That is with AOD running and also the Adaptive Screen feature turned on.\n\nI hope to reach people through my experience who are looking for a change, from apple or Samsung or anywhere. I absolutely suggest you do it! Android is amazing, and being so dependant on our phones in this day and age, to see Google giving people useful day to day technology is incredible.\n\nI wish so many reviewers weren't so biased against the pixel, or that there was more awareness of how great it is. If there was I feel I would have saved myself time and landed with one in the first place.\n\nI couldn't be happier and if you have made it this far, thank you for reading.

Also, Pixels put the smart in smartphones.\n\nHaving said that, I can't agree with the opinion on the lack of OneUI features. I recently came from a modern Oxygen OS phone and that thing is closer to stock than OneUI. Look at Samsung, they do everything to distance themselves from Google and Android. Every bit of their hardware is strongly flavoured with their own recipe. Perhaps Samsung knows that the world ain't ready for a 3rd OS and that's why they are sticking with Android. It's like I had to do a bit of learning to know the in and outs of OneUI\n\nCall screening is limited to the US and yes live translations in the messages app are indeed nice. Then again RCS, Lens and photo editor features are no longer Pixel exclusive. Top that with Google's horrendous support, it is difficult to inspire confidence in buying one. Tensor was marred with modem issues; poor thermals and not great efficiency. And these were inconsistent; some had no problems and others couldn't wait to trade off their phone. So the criticisms are not totally unfounded. So combine inconsistent hardware with poor support, well I don't want to play Russian roulette with my money and Pixels are notorious for ageing not well.\n\nAmongst many reasons, iPhones and Apple products, in general, tend to do so well is they're consistent and Pixels can't match that atm.\n\nAs much as I love the Pixel my head won't allow me to pull the trigger. And yes people are buying more Pixels. Japan for instance is an iPhone-dominated market and I see multiple stores aggressively marketing and see people with more Pixels as well.\n\nAlso, stop watching every YoutuTube \"review\". Watch a good couple of them and read reviews on sites like GSMArena. Sure raw hardware power doesn't equate to a good phone but it guarantees your phone doesn't visibly slow down after 2 years. A phone with a mid SoC and a slower memory works well in the 1-1. 5 years and then it drops.

Thus, even though the host requested that I paid for an extra 16 days in advance of my arrival to keep the room I agreed (she did not want to leave it empty, she said).\r  \n\r  \n(2) The bed in my room was actually a mattress. In fact, two out of three rooms on my floor had mattresses - one thicker, the other rather thin. The photos were rather misleading and nowhere in the descriptions did she mention it.\r  \n\r  \n(3) There were no lights in the sitting room. There was a desk lamp on the dining table, and even the open kitchen's lights were so-so. Not that bright. Thus, if one came back home late and the lights were off, he/she had to wade carefully from the entrance to the bedroom and be careful not to bump into things.\r  \n\r  \n(4) The oven is forever broken. Only light cooking was allowed.\r  \n\r  \n(5) the garden (front and back) was decrepit. The plants were dying. the back garden was in a sorry state. It got better because the host actually had the nerve to ask a male guest (from a developing country in Africa) to help fix it while she watched one Saturday. The surprising thing was that the guest agreed to do so, even though she did not pay him for his service.\r  \n\r  \n(6) The host was in her mid-60s. She was quite communicative via SMS. This was the only good thing about her. However, she's overly endearing tone was rather off-putting for me. She complained in person to me about the \"rudeness\" of some introverted guests. She complained about her health problems, and expected at least one of us to be at the house when a new guest arrived. She even told me that she felt depressed and kept asking me to socialize with her. I turned down all those invitations.\r  \n\r  \n(7) Fearing that she would give me a low rating (I expected to use Airbnb again in a couple of months), I gave her 5 stars and obtained a 5 star rating in return. However, I messaged her in private that I would not want anyone who forced me to pay for 16 extra days and treating it as a mere business transaction to impose additional obligations on me that were not in the deal (aka socializing with the host). I also \"lectured\" her on why introversion is a good thing.\r  \n\r  \nI was not hugely inconvenienced. Yet the whole thing left a strange taste in my mouth.

{"post": {"title": "Horrible guest with 3 \"service animals\"", "subreddit": "airbnb_hosts", "selftext": "I host an upscale 3 bedroom house in a colorado mountain town. I have only been hosting for about 4 months and generally all has been very positive. The very first guest to book my place had his stay this last weekend while there was a festival in town. He is a 5 star guest and host so I figured, this one will be easy, no issues. I get very little communication from him leading up to his check in date, which is totally normal, and the standard automated messages are sent out according to when I like them to be sent. Local activities, house rules and manuals, access codes, things like that. A couple days before the booking he asks if I can help him find an additional ticket for the festival, for which I give him a good resource where he can get one at face value. Not sure if he bought one or not but still, I helped him out. \n\nThe day before his  check in, I let him know that the place is already clean for him if he would like an early check in. This costs me nothing but is an appreciated gesture to extend to guests when I can. He says thank you but won't likely be early. Still no red flags.\n\nAt check in, I notice he brought 2 large dogs with him which is against our house rules and clearly stated. I say nothing because, a lot of people bring dogs against the rules and the ones who think they can hide it have never been a problem. Later I notice 3 more guests show up with a 3rd dog. Two things wrong here but still not worth much attention. 1) he only registered 2 guests. 2) A 3rd dog in a house that clearly states they are not allowed. The house sleeps 10 so plenty of room but it does help to have an accurate head count for safety and security purposes, and to ensure I put out enough stuff like coffee pods, detergent, soaps, etc.\n\nCheck out day comes and now is when shit (literally) starts going wrong. First, they stay past check out time close to an hour delaying my cleaning crew from getting started. Then my cleaning crew notify me that the garage has dog shit everywhere and reaks of dog and excrement. Then they notify me of the dog hair all over the house and the huge messes they left everywhere! Food all over the place, dog scratches on doors, windows and walls, the place is just a mess and I'm going to have to fix some minor cosmetic things. \n\nI contact the Guest asking about the dogs and extra guests and the state of the house. He has already left me a review at this point but I have no idea if it is good or bad.  First he states there were only two dogs and they are both his service animals \ud83d\ude44. When I ask him the ada approved questions he changes his story that they are emotional support animals \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44. Only after I show him multiple images of the 3rd dog going in and out of the front door does he \"remember\" the 3rd dog and states that \"it is also a service animal, probably an emotional support animal too\" his words. He denies the poop in the garage until confronted with photos and offers to pay for a furniture blanket that was taken off of a shelf and used to clean up 1 of the numerous piles of poop on the floor. I am waiting for final invoice from my cleaning crew and from the company I will hire to deodorize the garage. Hopefully I can get reimbursed for all this since he has admitted to everything in chat. \n\nI intend to leave him a detailed and honest review. Something along these lines unless someone here has any suggestions.\n\nUnfortunately, we had issues with Stuart and his guests and I am unable to recommend him, in good conscience to other hosts. Firstly they brought 3 dogs with them without notifying us, which is against our house rules. When asked, Stuart stated there were only 2 dogs and they were his service animals, which he later changed to say they were emotional support animals. The 3rd dog he only remembered about once I showed him photos of it entering and leaving the front door from the motion activated security camera that faces the street. This dog, he also stated is a service animal and he assumed also an emotional support animal. All of the dogs were left unattended for many hours on multiple days at the property which is against ADA guidelines, the fair housing act, and airbnb accessability policy, in addition to just being bad dog owner behavior. The dogs, left for so long alone,  unfortunately defecated all over the garage, which Stuart chose to leave for us. The rest of the house was a mess and there was some minor cosmetic damage caused by the dogs. Stuart left the house nearly 1 hour after check out, delaying the cleaning crew from starting, which thankfully wasn't an issue since there were multiple days before the next booking. I did hear from the neighbors that Stuart and his guests were quiet so I can at least say one good thing came out of the stay. \n\nAny other suggestions would be welcomed. I am hoping I can get the additional costs my cleaning crew are charging me as well as the deodorizing service covered through the resolution center.", "ups": 234, "permalink": "/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/16swj4w/horrible_guest_with_3_service_animals/", "num_comments": 103}, "replies": [{"selftext": "&amp;#128171; Please be aware that /u/mcwilcr does not have a verification flair.

We wanted to renegotiate our contract with her.  We took away alot of her responsibilities because we realized how to automate them. We wanted her to focus on changing door codes, maintain/update listing if needed, pricing updates, be available for boots on ground if needed (additional fee negotiable) for 10% after major expenses. She declined. She stated that for her new contracts she takes 25% before expenses. I think that amount is absurd.

{"post": {"title": "A Hard Lesson for Hosts", "subreddit": "airbnb_hosts", "selftext": "I don't know how well this will be received, but I wanted to share with all hosts a very hard lesson that took us a while to learn.  But, once we came to terms with this, it made hosting a whole lot easier.  That lesson is that a Guest is never...ever...your friend.  To be a successful host it is best to get a very thick skin and also quickly comes to terms with the concept that guests are essentially strangers in your home.  You know nothing about them, can't trust them, and given the opportunity, in a minute, the guest will burn you as a host.\n\nIt sounds harsh, but it is reality.  The sweetest, kindest, friendliest guest, in mere seconds, can turn into a nightmare guest filing complaints and trying to get your listing banned from AirBNB.  Most guests are nice people, but things can go south very quickly if they don't get their way.  Denying refunds, charging for extra services, or not being able to provide a booking extension can turn that friendly amicable guest into a one-star review who calls AirBNB to file a serious complaint, sometimes which isn't even true.\n\nThe point of this is to make the AirBNB as autonomous as possible so such situations are impossible to happen to begin with. To have a listing where there is never a situation where a guest asks the host to bend a rule or violate AirBNB policy.  For instance, we recently had a couple who wanted us to refund the cleaning fee, give them access to our housekeeper's vacuum, and let them clean the room themselves.  We showed them the ordinance of our short-term rental license which said an AirBNB guest could not clean their own room when a housekeeper service had been previously contracted and a cleaning fee already provided.  The same thing for late checkouts, early arrivals, and adding extra guests.  The agreement at the time of booking spells all of this out, sets the fees, and can't be changed.\n\nLastly, there have been situations we have read about on the Internet about hosts getting way to friendly with guests, doing things like trying to stay in contact after the booking has ended, or doing things like driving them around town, buying them dinner, or taking them out for a night on the city.   I will say in the past few years stories like that have died down, but they were very common about five years ago.  The end result was often accusations against the host for improper behavior, especially in cases of male hosts engaging in activities with female guests.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, its best to remember.  A guest is a stranger in your home, you don't know anything about them, who they really are, or how they truly behave.  Don't make the mistake of believing a guest is your best friend - they are not.", "ups": 53, "permalink": "/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/16qvopc/a_hard_lesson_for_hosts/", "num_comments": 44}, "replies": [{"selftext": "&amp;#128171; Please be aware that /u/RaiseVast does not have a verification flair.

You just need to have an airtight lease. It is your right to block mail if that is what you want but i would make it clear at the time of booking if you have unusual rules like that so they can cancel if they want, and if it was listed in your house rules/listing, then thats your perogative and far be it for me to tell you how to manage your listing. Also, closing your mail is not likely going to make any real difference on someone claiming residency if thats what they intend to do.\n\nBut since you are soliciting comment from the community, I will tell you that you can't do this job living in constant fear. I would suggest not accepting long term rentals if the threat of someone establishing residency is really something you are worried about. Our job is to provide reasonable accommodations at a premium price to a long term lease. Making guests happy, and comfortable, among other things, is our job.

I have more than one property on Airbnb that are independent private living quarters away from my home. Despite the losses I took due to the damages caused by Airbnb guests, Airbnb rejected both my claims saying that my claim was older than 30 days and so expired. I am pointing out on the AirCover insurance scam policies set and executed by Airbnb here. To all my fellow hosts that are victims of this scam, Kindy file a complaint with your state's Commissioner of Insurance for each of your Airbnb (Resolution center) claim rejected by Airbnb. \n\n1) Airbnb resolution center claims  expire in 30 days from the day of submission - this rule is set by Airbnb. A legitimate insurance company does not do that. I had a minor scratch &amp; dent card accident in April 2019. I submitted a claim to my insurance company in June 2021 and then took my car to their designated body shop in two months because I was busy traveling. Nationwide did pay for my car repair caused by the accident as well as rental car. \n\n2) Numerous Airbnb claim processing agents work on a single claim - on both my Airbnb claims, numerous Airbnb agents sent me emails and messages in various points of time during 30-day period that each of them were working on my case. Each agent will ask that I tell them the details on what happened. This is a web created by Airbnb to exhaust the hosts. Airbnb knows that the hosts are extremely busy cleaning and preparing and taking care of the Airbnb guests and so the hosts will give up. A genuine insurance company will have only one single agent assigned to a claim that will consistently work with the claimant over the time until closing. \n\n3) Delay and expire claims by Design - Airbnb agents sends emails saying that his or her shift is over for the day and s/he will resume the claim assessment on his/her next shift - this is Airbnb's way to tell the host to wait and be patient as time goes by. Then some Airbnb claim processing agent will send an email concluding that the claim is rejected because 30-day window is expired.", "ups": 0, "permalink": "/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/16qp0wx/victims_of_airbnb_aircover_scam_kindly_file_a/", "num_comments": 13}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I\u2019ve had trouble getting covered but mostly because I didn\u2019t understand the reporting burden on me.

{"post": {"title": "Newbie configuring the profitability?", "subreddit": "airbnb_hosts", "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nI have an opportunity to rent out a new family property beginning this November. The home is 3bd 2.5 ba and 1,166 sqft. It's located in a suburban area in Omaha, NE, USA.\n\nMy dad wants to just do renters and have a monthly rent of $2100 but I think the property can go further if I convert it into an AirBnb. I'd like to be my dad's tenant and then be the property's Airbnb host so I can pay the rent and then profit from the rest of the property.\n\nI'm exploring the idea and trying to congifure what the costs might be to furnish it, insure the business, get cameras set up, all the bells and whistles ... I feel like if I'm to do this, I want to hit the ground running so it can be ready for this holiday season.\n\nBut I'm young, I don't have much money and I understand that this would take a few thousands of dollars just to furnish this alone (that I'd have to put on credit cards or take a loan out for). My worry is that I'd need to spend a lot up front and then I heard that reservations really drop in January and February and I'd still be expected to pay that $2100 for the morgage. I live in the same city so I'd take on the responsibility of being the cleaner and go-to person for guest requests/needs on-demand.\n\nI've done light research and see that there are a few other homes in the area ([image link here](https://www.reddit.com/user/SecondNo7343/comments/16q9h2m/airbnb_competitor_research/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). The search was for one week in November for two guests \u2014 there are other AirBnb listings but I have no idea if this is a lot or what. The property is in the suburbs so there is a lot more compeition/demand for the downtown/midtown city areas and less for the suburbs.\n\nCan anyone give me some insights on if this looks like a good idea given the market, the property as described and how much I'd need to profit to really make this investment worth it in the long run?\n\nAny resources for websites/groups to help aspiring hosts would be great as well!", "ups": 0, "permalink": "/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/16q9mre/newbie_configuring_the_profitability/", "num_comments": 11}, "replies": [{"selftext": "&amp;#128171; Please be aware that /u/SecondNo7343 does not have a verification flair.

If they're not friendly to this use, you can try to wing it for a while, but there's a strong chance the rug will get yanked from under you after you've committed to this business. If they're good with it, make sure you understand your city and state requirements for registering your unit and paying hotel tax, as that'll be something you'll need to do.\n\nMake sure your location REALLY lends itself to STR use. If you're super packed in with neighbors, some of whom are weird or hostile, and you're targeting a lower-end guest mix who'll throw parties or bring hookups home or whatever, it's a powder keg. On the other hand, if the place is on a generous lot giving good separation from neighbors, and you're pricing and screening to attract more stable guests, you'll do much better.\n\nYou'd rent the whole house, and not be living there while hosting guests in rooms? I really think the former is the way to go; you'll see tons of problems in this forum tying back to hosts trying to share space with guests.\n\nPeople are making great points about cleaning and laundry. With 3+ bedrooms, laundry will take longer than cleaning. Even when I have my cleaners turn a house, I go there with my laptop afterward and catch up on email while running the last couple loads of laundry.\n\nDoing your own turns can be a great source of extra income; depending on your pricing, it can, for example, turn a $150 night into a $250 night (if you keep the $100 cleaning fee). I have a pro cleaning crew but have started doing occasional turns myself when they're easy (e.g., 1 or 2 people for 1 night). I leave the big jobs to my regular crew.\n\nGet 3 sets of sheet per bed - that way you can strip the beds, immediately remake them, and have spares if there's a bad stain. You'll want white sheets so you can bleach out stains. Having the same size beds (e.g., queen) in all bedrooms helps laundry go faster. One of my places has a king, two queens, and a full, and it's a pain to tell which fitted and flat sheets are which when they're all white.\n\nYou don't really need to \"insure the business\" as much as you need to make sure the house's insurance policy allows STR use - your dad may need to switch carriers to get this. Also, he should think about a legal structure for holding the property in order to minimize liability should someone fall off the porch and break their leg and sue or whatever. Also, you probably want to set up your business as an LLC to similarly limit your own liability. A good accounting firm can get you set up well here.\n\nI find it pretty easy to keep my own books in a spreadsheet - I also use Quickbooks as I have other real estate stuff, but it's very expensive and IMO overkill for 1 STR property. Just log your income and expenses as they happen (or within a day afterward) and categorize them in a way that makes sense (Repairs, Consumables, Taxes, etc.). Also learn to differentiate between capital expenditures (furniture, big repairs, etc.) and regular operating expenses.\n\nOnce your listing is stabilized on Airbnb, you should strongly consider getting your place on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com). I recently added Booking to my mix and it quickly moved way ahead of Vrbo as my second strongest platform. I realized this is because it places it right next to actual hotels when people are searching in my town - i.e., a business or weekend traveler is looking for a hotel, and the results they get are the Holiday Inn and my houses. It's hella powerful. It's also a lot more complicated to set up than Airbnb, so I suggest you get fully up and running on Airbnb first and then in a few months extend to Booking.\n\nFinally, it's near impossible to be instantly profitable with this, but the bookings do happen and the money does roll in. There are hundreds of little lessons to learn, but if you take the stance of an empathetic host seeking to give a great guest experience, and you learn from every stumble and adjust your systems to do better next time, your numbers will look better in time. And you'll learn a ton about business.\n\nGood luck!", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "--Orcanaught--", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "You shouldn\u2019t do it.

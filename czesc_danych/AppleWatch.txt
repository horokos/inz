I've got a relatively small six-inch wrist and I was worried about the 49mm Ultra being too large. But here's what I found: it all depends on the shape of your wrist, specifically the distance between your radius and ulna bones and the flatness of the top of your wrist.  \nSurprisingly, the Ultra 2 fits me quite comfortably. So, if you've been concerned about wrist size, take a moment to consider your wrist's shape\u2014it might make a big difference!  \nAnother reason I was worried about switching to the Ultra is because I have a bunch of bands that I thought may no longer look good with the Ultra. I actually had a blue AW for a while and was disappointed in how few band colors complimented the colors- too many clashed in a big way. I was concerned that my collection might not work as well with the Ultra 2, but they actually fit just fine, and they feel a tad roomier. I can't explain why, but it's a nice bonus for those of us who like to change up our bands. I\u2019ve tried every Apple band I have and they all look terrific on the Ultra.   \nLastly, there have been posts about the challenges of sleeping with the Ultra 2, but personally, it hasn't been an issue for me. I've been using a comfortable band, especially the nylon sport band, and it feels no different than when I wore the stainless model to bed. So, if sleep tracking is important to you, don't let the size put you off\u2014it can be just as comfortable as the smaller models.  \nIn summary, my switch to the Apple Watch Ultra 2 has been surprisingly smooth and comfortable, despite my initial concerns about wrist size and band compatibility.

Sometimes Apple covers failures from swimming, but it's not guaranteed, so I suggest getting AppleCare+ if you do plan to swim.

Here is what eight years of Apple Watch looks like in CNET reviews.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Series 0**\n\nBeautifully constructed. Handles messages well. A solid fitness tracker. Hundreds of apps. Can send and receive voice calls via an iPhone. Lots of design choices. Apple Pay-enabled. Stores music for local playback over Bluetooth.\n\n**Series 1**\n\nAlong with the new Apple Watch Series 2, the company has rebranded the original smartwatch to be called the Series 1. But it's not just a name change -- it's also getting an upgraded dual-core processor chip for faster performance speeds and a cheaper price tag.\n\n**Series 2**\n\nThe new Apple Watch is faster, has a far better OS, onboard GPS, a brighter display and is waterproof to 50 meters in salt or fresh water.\n\n**Series 3**\n\nCellular connection works well for phone calls, email, Siri and messages. Music now syncs more easily. Improvements in fitness tracking and added watch faces. Adds barometer to GPS and swimproofing. Same overall size as last year\u2019s watch.\n\n**Series 4**\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 offers a larger, crisp display that shows more with less bezel, super fast speed and a louder speaker. It adds high and low heart-rate detection, fall detection with SOS trigger and an FDA-cleared ECG app for more detailed heart readings.\n\n**Series 5**\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 adds an always-on display, so it can show the time all the time. An added compass aids navigation and improves elevation readings. Cellular models gain an international SOS mode.\n\n**Series 6**\n\nAlways-on display looks bright even after it's timed-out. Measures blood oxygen levels automatically. Better battery life during runs.\n\n**Series 7**\n\nQWERTY keyboard lets you type on the watch. Faster charging makes it easy to top off the battery. Bigger buttons in apps and lock screen.\n\n**Series 8**\n\nFast performance. Temperature tracking and car-crash detection. WatchOS 9 upgrades are great.\n\n**Ultra**\n\nAction button is fantastic. Bright, big screen. Best battery life of any Apple Watch. Dual-band GPS is more accurate than earlier watches.\n\n**Series 9**\n\nFaster Siri performance. More precise at finding a misplaced iPhone. Wide variety of health and fitness features. Double Tap lets you use the watch without touching it.\n\n**Ultra 2**\n\nIncredibly bright screen.

{"post": {"title": "I've been going phoneless for 5 months now and I love it. If you've been thinking about trying it, do it!", "subreddit": "AppleWatch", "selftext": "Everyone's preferences and situation is different, so this is not a \"you should do this\" post. Rather, it's a \"if you've been thinking about doing this or wanting to try it, let me reassure you that it can work really well\" post. Happy to answer any specific \"but what about XYZ?\" questions if folks are curious.\n\nFor about 5 months now (since I got my Apple Watch Ultra) I haven't been carrying my phone with me. Most days my phone lives in a drawer in my living room, plugged in and connected to my home wifi network. I'll occasionally take it in to work with me if I know I'll need a specific MFA app on it that isn't available for the watch, but even then the phone lives in the bottom of my backpack under my desk all day. And my phone stays in the drawer even when I'm home. I primarily use my phone to periodically review my health &amp; exercise tracker stats (since I can't view those on the watch or computer). My avg. daily screen time is &lt; 10 minutes some weeks. I've also downgraded my wallet to a minimalist $10 band ([this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BM573B5T?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)) on a lanyard. So the ONLY thing in any of my pockets is at most my ID, credit card, and work badge in this band. And I often go around with absolutely nothing in my pockets (keypad lock on my house + apple pay on the watch). I truly love it. The freedom of having nothing in my pockets. Never having to find my phone, worry about transferring pocket contents when switching from work pants to comfy pants at the end of the day. I never feel naked (even when I'm naked! :P). I can just get up and go wherever whenever I want. No tethers.\n\nEmail (and honestly most text messages) are done on my laptop. In an emergency I can text through my watch (the voice to text works surprisingly well), but I like that it's inconvenient because I don't actually need to be constantly texting. AW has maps if I get lost, and I can send and receive calls no problem (sometimes carry airpods for this and for listening to music from AW, but can also just use the AW speaker &amp; microphone for calls). I know it sounds cliche, but I really do feel so much more present too. I used to try to be glued to my phone less, but it's so hard to resist a temptation that's always there. But turns out now that I don't have my phone on me and I literally can't just mindlessly open up Instagram or Reddit or Google things there actually isn't any temptation to do so. I don't have to use up any will power throughout my day from resisting distractions. And also turns out I don't miss any of them. I think it's been long enough now that any initial novelty has worn off and I'm not just saying this because it feels new (I deliberately waited a few months before making this post for that reason). I have every intention to keep living this way.\n\n*Edit:* Some extra quick details some people asked about:\n\n* I do use my watch for sleep tracking. I primarily charge it when I shower and get ready in the morning, and can do a quick 10 - 20 minute \"top off\" before I leave work or before I go to bed. It's rarely below \\~40% battery.\n* I leave my watch permanently in \"Do Not Disturb\" mode (except when in sleep tracker mode at night). So, I don't get any notifications except phone calls from people in my contacts list. I also turned off the red dot notification indicator. I can proactively check notifications whenever I want, but my attention doesn't get forcefully usurped by the watch\n* I have Verizon as my carrier.\n* I usually have bluetooth turned off on my phone so that it does not steal control of my airpods from my watch.", "ups": 32, "permalink": "/r/AppleWatch/comments/16plcb1/ive_been_going_phoneless_for_5_months_now_and_i/", "num_comments": 29}, "replies": [{"selftext": "This is AWESOME!!!

But I realized (again in my case) I rarely ever actually go back and look at the million pictures I (used to) take anyway.

My bank fortunately lets me use the \"text a code\" option for verification (fine on watch) so I don't need my phone for that.

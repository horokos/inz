I had put a brand new tune on my Mustang and wasn't familiar with how it felt yet. Wifey and I wanted sushi and so we placed an order and drove over to Prattville to pick it up. Everything was fine but the roads were rough with how much rain was coming down. \nWhile making a left onto my road, my car did a 180 in the rain going prolly under 30. I didn't think anything of it and was just thankful I didn't hit the stop sign. Now my car is facing the wrong way so I turn around and keep going. *Blue lights light up the sky behind me*\n\nI immediately pull over even with my house in sight. Me and wifey calmly wait, my hands remain on the steering wheel. Cop walks up to my window (closest to the road) \"Good afternoon sir, I assume you're just checking in making sure I'm okay?\" I ask knowing he saw me sliding in the rain. I see the guy's face and recognize him as he had pulled me over a month earlier for another stupid reason (I'll cover that later). \n\n\"Why the hell are you out here doing donuts in the rain son?!?\" The cop demands. \nMe: I wasn't doing donuts sir, I honestly just slid in the rain. \nCop: No, I saw you doing donuts in that intersection right there. \nMe: Sir, we are just on our way home from picking up sushi. This isn't  a good place to even do donuts. I honestly just slid in the rain. \nCop: I know what I saw and I saw you doing donuts in the intersection. \nMe: I didn't even do a 360, how is that a donut? \nCop: No I saw you do a 360 which is a donut. Quit arguing with me before you get yourself in deeper.\n\n*Takes my information, I hand him my out of state license, wifey retrieves my registration from the glove box. The cop takes it back to his car.*\n\nAfter talking with wifey for 5 mins about how we weren't doing donuts and just want to get home and eat, the cop starts approaching the driver side window again. Cop gets on the radio and is talking with someone asking them to run my plates to see if the car is stolen. The car isn't stolen and the person confirms this. The cop asks if I have any warrants to the other person. I don't and they confirm this. They ask to confirm my driver's license. The person reads my full name, home of record, driver's license number, height, hair color, etc all back perfectly. From this point forward the cop begins calling me by my middle name for literally no reason. \n\nCop: What the hell are you doin way out here? Arent you a little far from home? \nMe: Sir, I live right there *points to house* I am stationed over at Maxwell-Gunter Annex. Ive been here for a few years. \nCop: Yeah but why are you here? \nMe: *now super confused how this guy doesn't understand* sir im military, im in the USAF. Ive been stationed here for a couple of years. I live at *address* and my home of record is *address*. Do you need to see my CAC/military ID? \nCop: No I dont need to see your ID. Your this close to getting a ticket right now son. \nMe: I'm sorry sir, I just dont understand what I did wrong. I didn't do any donuts I only made a 180 after sliding in the rain and turned myself around so I was facing the right way on the road and wasn't driving into oncoming traffic. \nCop: You were doing donuts. A 180 and then turning back around is a 360 so you were doing donuts. \nMe: * finally realizing the issue was the fact that I turned around so I wasnt in oncoming traffic*  sir, I have a dash cam showing I wasnt doing any donuts. I spun in the rain and turned back around to avoid causing an accident. \nCop: You said you're down here for the military? \nMe: yes sir, I'm stationed at maxwell-gunter. \nCop: well we respect our military around here and I'm just gonna let you off with a warning this time. Do you have any questions?\nMe: Yeah I do actually. What should I have done in your opinion after sliding in the rain?\nCop: you should've made a right turn then turned around to get back on this road. \nMe: you wanted me to turn right even though I was facing oncoming traffic, instead of just turning around to face the right way and continuing on my way?\nCop: Correct, anything else?\nMe: *bewildered* um, I guess not. \nCop: Okay, y'all have a nice night now. \nWe drive for 30 seconds, pull into the driveway, and finally eat our sushi.  \n\nAbout a month prior to this I was on my way to work and had made a right at that intersection which has a stoplight immediately after for a few businesses. I left home and got caught at the light. I sat at the red light and just before it changed a cop pulled up behind me. The light turns green, his lights turn blue. I go through the light and pull over. The cop once again questions me as to why I'm in Alabama with an out of state vehicle and I once again explain I'm military and ask if he wants to see my ID (I'm literally in uniform). He says sure looks at it and hands it back. \nCop: do you know how fast you were going back there?\nMe: (I usually answer no and give some BS reason) yes sir, zero. \nCop: how'd you get that? \nMe: the light was red and I was stopped at it. \nCop: no before the light. \nMe: no more than 40 because I had just turned from the three way before the light. \nCop: you know the speed limit here right? \nMe: well its a 45 that becomes a 35 after the light. \nCop: so you were speeding. \nMe: Sir, I have a dash cam that shows I wasn't going over 45. I dont know if anyone could even go over 45 in such short distance. \nCop: Oh so you're stationed down at Maxwell right? \nMe: yeah.\nCop: well we respect our military around here so I'm going to let you off with a warning. Do you have any other questions?\nMe: No sir. (I was pissed for even being pulled over knowing I didn't do anything wrong. I wanted to ask how fast I was going but was starting to run late for work and just wanted to get going)\n\nAfter being pulled over at the red light, I told my supervisor who essentially wanted me to report him for disrespecting a military member (for those who dont understand and would rather just get out of a ticket, its disrespectful because he was caught on camera trying to give me a ticket even though I had done nothing wrong and when told about the camera he used my military status as a reason to not). After the second incident in the rain, my supervisor told me the same thing but I was about to PCS so I never did. Both times it was the same cop. \n\nIn general, I always give them my license and when I get questioned about being out of state I tell them im in the USAF and offer my CAC. Only once have I still gotten a ticket but it was because I was kind of a dick after having a pretty rough week. Never do I start the conversation with hey im military or shove my CAC in their face. I feel thats disrespectful and wrong. \n\nHow often are you getting pulled over? I never got pulled over while being stationed in Europe. I got pulled over once back home for actually speeding. I got pulled over a lot in Alabama but feel like driving a mustang made me a target even if I wasn't doing anything wrong. \n\nMy advice: Be respectful and have a dash cam.", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "xx-Shadow-xx22", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "\u201cDo you need my military ID as well?\u201d \n\nWorks every time", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "Notthatcoolyet", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Never.\n\nCorrect procedure is to keep it behind your DL so when you give the officer your license its sitting there in plain view.

In my head felt the world was collapsing around me. I ended up just stopping taking a breath. And acknowledge that the feelings are there. Acknowledge that the world is not collapsing around me. And proceeded to be the best TSgt I could be until I ETS'd.\n\nI basically decided that I could not do anything about feeling anxious. I could only do something about my response to feeling anxious. So everyone I worked with thought I was calm cool and collected but honestly, I wasn't much away from a mental break down for no reason on every given day.\n\nI came to that work-around basically because I wanted my people to be able to come to me if they needed anything. If they need to talk, if they need time off, if they need technical or life advice, I was the person. That was my job I was a TSgt. If they felt like I was going to snap at any given moment, they may have been less comfortable coming to me with things.\n\nAfter separating I realized that a lot of the anxiety like 90% was due to being in the military. As a TSgt you know that if you fail a PT test by any amount for any reason that is a missing dec, a bad EPR, you are a failure as a NCO and you have a very good chance of not making MSgt for the next x amount of time.

{"post": {"title": "Government Shutdown", "subreddit": "AirForce", "selftext": "Week 1: Government shut down this morning. Drive on to base. No traffic. Fuck, this is dope, dude. Gov should shut down more often.  Arrive at squadron, plenty of parking. No contractors, but we're able to get the sorties scheduled and generated. Green suiters and OCPs everywhere.  Man, this almost feels like a fraternity or some shit, this is awesome. Go to MPF to get CAC updated. Get turned away because no civilians are around. Fuck.\n\nWeek 2: The high of \"military only\" has started to fade. Morale begins to deteriorate when the trash is piling up, and the toilets begin to get clogged. At least the gym is open. Our ceiling begins to leak when it rains, and after calling CE to put in a ticket, the forecasted completion date is in 4 months. Also FUCK.\n\nWeek 4: TDYs, vouchers, new equipment, and support functions are non-existent.  The squadron literally smells like a fucking shithole because \"BRACKET\" refused to change his diet during the shutdown and has clogged not one, but two toilets. However, in a weird turn of events, camaraderie is getting tighter.  We are finding workarounds, solutions, and efficiency in this time.  No one has had to take a CBT or a piss test in 4 weeks. I should probably be concerned about that.... At least I have USAA, so money's coming in. Some people are starting to feel the pain. Fuckity Fuck.\n\nWeek 8: Congress came close to a resolution, but a representative from Oklahoma didn't like the bill's wording of \"prophylactic\" instead of \"contraception\" or some shit, so they're going back to the drawing board.  I swear, electing these smooth brained knuckle dragging knob-gobblers to Congress with zero accountability is fucked. I wrote my congressman, they're from the other party, but I at least did what I could.  I blame social media and Reddit. Toilet paper is in a black market state, and used as bribes for the students to their IPs instead of bottles of whiskey. Triple Fuck.\n\nWeek 12: I wiped my ass with printer paper this afternoon. There is no more toilet paper, no paper towels, and no soap to wash hands. The anticipated parts to arrive to fix the jets haven't come in and we cannot Frankenstein anymore jets together to put birds in the air. We're lucky if we can get one sortie going. The popcorn maker doesn't work due to overusage, we cannot buy anything because GTC is locked, and there is nothing to do at the squadron. We have graduated from despair to pure surrender. The LTs tried to do a burger burn to get morale up, but due to their ineptitude, one of them lit themselves on fire and is now DNIF for the foreseeable future. Morale went up amongst the IP cadre. Get Fucked.\n\nWeek 13: Budget passed. Things are moving at light speed. Orders are processed and turned in record time.  Leadership said we need to \"catch up\" to the production timeline.  We thought shutdown was bad, catch up is worse. Double turning on weekends and denying leave. At least our bathrooms are FMC now, and the civilians are happy to be at work.  I'd be happy as well if I got a free 13 week vacation. Although a different type of suck is about to occur, I'm looking forward to flying and instructing again.

{"post": {"title": "The True Story of Jeremiah Weed", "subreddit": "AirForce", "selftext": "I don't think this story has ever been posted here. The author, Dick Anderegg, was the Director of the Air Force History &amp; Museums program for a number of years and wrote a couple of books including this one, and one on the evacuation of Clark Field after eruption of Mount Pinatubo.  \n\n\n&gt;Every USAF fighter squadron has a lounge where the pilots sometimes gather for a cold beer after the flying day is over. Every refrigerator in each of those lounges contains a chilled bottle of a 100-proof product called Jeremiah Weed. For special occasions, and sometimes for no reason at all, someone will bring out the Weed, fill a shot glass for each person present, and propose a toast. At the conclusion of the toast, all down their Weed in a single gulp. It is not tasty. To many it seems like drinking kerosene, and it leaves a very strong aftertaste. Be that as it may, few refuse because the downing of a Weed is a ritual deeply imbedded in the fighter pilot culture. That ritual started long before today\u2019s squadron commanders were even in college, and stories abound as to how the custom started. A famous newsman once said, \u201cWhen there is disagreement between the legend and the truth, always print the legend.\u201d Since I disagree, here is the true story of Jeremiah Weed, and I know it\u2019s true because I was part of it.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;On December 1, 1978, I was flying as an instructor in the back seat of a F\u20134E, tail number 649, on a BFM hop out of the 414th FW Sq at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The student in my front seat, Maj. Nort Nelson, was a highly experienced F\u20134 pilot with hundreds of combat hours. Leading the flight was Capt. Joe Bob Phillips, who had in his back seat Capt. Larry Ernst, an instructor who was just along for the ride. The mission called for Joe Bob to attack Nort in a scripted scenario that gave Nort the opportunity to use his best defensive BFM to defeat Joe Bob\u2019s attacks. The mission did not last long. On the first engagement, Nort managed to put the airplane into a position from which I judged that recovery was impossible. I ejected both of us from the jet. Neither of us was injured, and within an hour we were picked up by a helicopter that returned us to Nellis. It probably goes without saying that Nort and I had different views: he thought he could miss the ground; I did not. It was too close to bet my life on. The accident investigators agreed with me. They determined that ejection was the only possibility for survival. Further, they believed that if I had delayed more than a second, one or both of us would have died in the desert seventy miles north of Las Vegas.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;A year later, both Joe Bob and Nort were members of the F\u201316 Multinational Operational Test and Evaluation squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. On the first anniversary of the accident, they were flying to Nellis to participate in Red Flag. As they passed over the crash site, which Joe Bob easily found since he had circled our downed position many times, they sketched some brief road maps on cards in their cockpits and decided to return to the site by car.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next day, a Friday, they drove out of Las Vegas with a friend, Pete Mock, intending to find the site and camp out in the crater that the crashing airplane had gouged in the high desert. However, it was dark by the time they got to the dirt road they thought would lead them to the site. After a couple of aborted attempts to drive up dirt roads to nowhere, they decided to go back to a roadside caf\u00e9 they had passed to ask directions.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;They entered the Paranaghat Bar and found no customers, only a bearded bartender who looked a lot like Grizzly Adams. When they told the bartender what they were up to, he was delighted to tell them he had seen the fire from the crashing airplane the day of the accident. Further, he was very pleased that he had three real fighter pilots in his bar. He had heard that fighter pilots knew many bar games (true), and he wanted to play games for drinks. When they balked at the idea, he persisted, and after much cajoling asked them if they knew the game \u201chorses.\u201d They shook their heads no (not true). Over the next several minutes, the bartender \u201ctaught\u201d them horses, finally saying that whoever lost had to buy a round of drinks. After three games of horses, the bartender had bought all three rounds. And after three rounds the pilots were a little less stressed to get to the crash site.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Joe Bob asked the bartender if he knew how to do afterburners. No, the bartender said, he had never heard of that game. So, Joe Bob explained to him how a shot of brandy in a shot glass is ignited so that the alcohol on top burns, and then the drinker throws down the flaming shot. If done correctly, all the brandy is emptied from the shot glass, so that when the drinker puts the glass down, a small, blue flame still burns in the bottom. The bartender was eager to play but said he had no brandy. Nort suggested that any high-proof booze might work, and the bartender fumbled around under the bar for a moment. He straightened up and plopped a tall, brown bottle with a brown and green label on the bar, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got this here stuff\u2014it\u2019s 100 proof.\u201d The brand name on the green label proclaimed that it was Jeremiah Weed. The three fighter pilots filled their shot glasses and demonstrated, all three glasses returning to the bar empty except for a small blue flame flickering at the bottom.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The bartender immediately poured one for himself and lit the top. Now, these were no ordinary twentieth-century shot glasses. Joe Bob thought they might be from the 1800s because the glass was very thick, and the bottom was probably an inch of heavy glass. When the bartender picked his up, he held it by the bottom while he licked and smoothed the mustache of his thick beard out of the line of fire. He took several moments on his grooming, not realizing that as he held the thick glass at the bottom, the top near the fire was heating quickly. By the time he tilted his head back and put the glass to his lips\u2026..well, Joe Bob says you could probably hear the s-s-s-s-sizzle of the hot glass barbecuing the bartender\u2019s lips halfway to Las Vegas. Then the bartender made his second mistake and flinched. The flaming Weed went all over his beard, and by the time Joe Bob, Nort, and Pete could beat out the flames, the bar was filled with the smell of cooked lips and singed hair.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;As soon as things calmed down a bit, the trio, feeling badly that they had not paid for a drink all night and greatly embarrassed that they had nearly immolated their new friend, bought another bottle of Weed from him and left again for the crash site, this time guided by one of the bartender\u2019s friends who had entered the bar just in time to witness and smell the blistering. The friend showed them the correct dirt road, and the trio found the crash crater, where they spent the rest of the night camped out and drinking the entire bottle of Weed.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next morning they dragged themselves out of the crater, gathered a few souvenirs from the parts still lying around, and headed straight for the Nellis Air Force Base Officers\u2019 Club. There they found the manager, showed her the empty bottle, and strongly suggested she add it to the bar stock. She did. Soon, the Nellis fighter pilots were downing shots of Weed (nonflaming) for no good reason except it was different, and it was a good excuse to toast \u201cfallen comrades.\u201d As Red Flags came through the Nellis club, they saw the weapons school guys doing it, so they did it, too.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;And that is the true story of how Jeremiah Weed started. I have a bottle in my freezer.\n\n Anderegg, Richard.

It's actually called the XFC-130H or YMC-130. if you look up just YC-130, it just shows a really old plane. \n\nBut I'll give you the dramatic re-enaction version. As the by the books one would take a while, and im tired, lol.  basically, during the Iranian hostage crisis in the 80s, they were looking for a way to break in and get the people out. They wanted to be able to carry all the people and move fast, and ideally, an mc-130 is the plane of choice in most of those scenarios. But they didn't have a runway available to them. The best thing they were able to find was a soccer stadium. And I like to imagine that because it was the 80s, in the room of generals, top level gov civilians, when they were thinking of ways trying to get the rescue team in quickly then get them and tge hostages out quickly, there was some wild ass colonel in the back corner of the room who just did a line of coke and said: \"why don't we just take an mc-130, and strap a bunch of rockets too it? So we can get up and down real fast?\" And basically, they were all like \"bro you're crazy and we like crazy. Let's do it.\"  So they took, I think, 3 c-130s and started HEAVILY modifying it. One for tearing apart and testing how everything would go together, another for implementing that stuff, and the third, which would be the operational/flight testing everything. They started building retractable kinda rocket boosters and jet packs that they essentially attached to a bunch of points in the front of the plane and aft fuselage. And it was working. It actually was coming together and flying. They built a c130 that could land and then take off in the space of a football field. Which is batshit crazy. They went through countless practice runs, getting everything perfect because the smallest error would ruin everything. Everything was going pretty smoothly and well for what was essentially the military aviation equivalent of rednecks welding explosives and fireworks to a Toyota hilux. They were actually going to use it. The plan was going to happen.  But on one of the very last testing runs, they let that miniscule level margin of error sneak its way in. Upon the landing, the pilot hit the rocket assist stop/landing a few seconds too early. Which meant they cut out too early. Because when you activate them, they have a limited amount of burn time. Less than 30 if i remember the video correctly. And there's no reignite. And because of physics, a plane that weighs over 140,000lbs dropping somewhere between 6-12 feet more than it should have with wings loaded with fuel...... the big dropped and broke hard. Blew up. Wings snapped off and everything. Luckily, no one was seriously injured, but the plane, that psychotic coke fueled Marvel.... like many legends from the 80s, she was gone. No repairs were possible, and the other two could not be made to fly the mission. So they ended up doing it with helicopters, I think? After the rocket 130 was no longer a part of it, I lost interest in the hostage crisis. But the story itself is a testament to what the AF used to be, what our mx and engineers and pilots came together to create, and what we can really do if we just hit the gas. Sure, fighters are fun and they break speed records. B1 and B2 bombers are technological marvels that change the game of war and international policy. And drones are the future. But none of them got the absolute baller, backwoods redneck, coked out, all or nothing swag of the 130 with rockets and cocaine.\n\nI recommend watching the video about it online", "ups": 7, "depth": 2, "author": "d710905", "replies": [{"selftext": "Tell it again \ud83e\udd79", "ups": 4, "depth": 3, "author": "ShrimpzCampy", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Magnificent, thank you!", "ups": 2, "depth": 3, "author": "castrum8", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"selftext": "Doughnuts if you're late to work", "ups": 10, "depth": 0, "author": "boricuainblues", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "We drop bombs and make moms and spread the seed of freedom baby!", "ups": 15, "depth": 0, "author": "sprkat85", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Cable in the hotel.", "ups": 5, "depth": 0, "author": "markydsade", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Heritage Rooms. \n\nHooches. \n\nMustache March.\n\nOnly ones I can think of that we don\u2019t share.", "ups": 6, "depth": 0, "author": "gallodiablo", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Air Force Security Forces is the only \u201cMP\u2019s\u201d that can carry one in the chamber and safety off\u2026that tells you a lot about the other branches lol", "ups": 7, "depth": 0, "author": "Cadetw0lf117", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Adding pronouns to your email.", "ups": 18, "depth": 0, "author": "JustCrayHere", "replies": [{"selftext": "Air Force is fr the only one?", "ups": 2, "depth": 1, "author": "OMG_its_critical", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "There's the giant anime sword ceremony (not really sure what it's for though) but that's really all I'm aware of.

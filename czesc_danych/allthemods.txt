You set up 2-4 Iron farms and you'll never need iron ever again. The breeder block is so much easier than vanilla, put in two villagers and some food and tada you're breeding. The trader blocks from this mod are also really good, just know that you'll need to put both a villager and their respective work block in it. (A farmer won't refresh their deals without a composter in the block)\n\nThe most OP weapon is Morgan from Mahou Tsukai, it just requires a bit of a grind from a mob farm (villagers).\n\nThe most OP armor is either Allthemodium, or Awakened Supremium. Allthemodium requires you to go to the deep dark with a netherite pick for your first one, so choose based on that imo. If you do go Allthemodium, use your first ore to make a teleport pad. Shift + right click to go to the mining dimension where a lot more Allthemodium ore spawns.\n\nFor Mob farms you have two early choices, Mob Grinding Utilities (with a Mob Swab for creating spawn eggs and Apotheosis spawners) and Drygmy from Ars Nouveau.

EVER!), automatic eating with food stored in the helmet, no fall damage, and more. Oh yeah, and you become basically invincible in it as any damage you take instead drains energy from the suit and health. You can combo this with  flux networks to wirelessly charge your suit anywhere.\n\nMeka suit can come in handy when trying to tackle Hostile Nueral Networks as you may be fighting some difficult mobs to get it off the ground when first starting the mod.\n\nYou can also go about you resource collecting with mekanism and create a collection of fluids, gasses, and radiation materials made from the machines. Could also possibly create some cool displays as all the gasses and fluids are different colors and can be seen inside mekanism tubes/pipes.\n\nAnother collection idea is that many mods have there own armor set.

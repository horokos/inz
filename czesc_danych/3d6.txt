It also gives you Healing Word for yo-yo healing, generally useful cantrips, and just overall utility goodies.\n\nWizard 17 gives you a bunch of stuff. Look at what other people say to learn all about Wizards. Significantly, Chronurgy Wizard gives you Convergent Future, which lets you decide how things go, but you take a level of exhaustion when you do.\n\nThe prompt constrains the true limits of the game, but you can still abuse Simulacrum with only one. Here\u2019s how to do it.\n\nOne of your items is a Ring of Three Wishes. Another is a Scroll of Shapechange. You also have Shapechange as a spell known.\n\n1. Use the Scroll of Shapechange to Shapechange into a Soul Monger. Among other things, this form has immunity to exhaustion, which lets you use Convergent Future every round for only a reaction. Choose for your equipment not to merge into your body.\n\n2. Use the Ring of Three Wishes to cast Simulacrum on yourself. The Simulacrum has \u201chas half the creature\u2019s hit point maximum\u201d and no items but it otherwise \u201cuses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.\u201d The wording here means that it will duplicate the Shapechanged version of you, what with having both all your class abilities and all the Soul Monger abilities.\n\n3. Have the Simulacrum use its 9th level spell slot to Shapechange into a Lesser Star Spawn Emissary. Shapechange says your game statistics are replaced by those of the new form, except you keep your mental ability scores, your proficiencies unless the new form has the same one but better, and the \u201cbenefit of any features from your class, race, or other source.\u201d As a result, when your Simulacrum changes form, it gets your original class features, the Soul Monger\u2019s features, and the Lesser Star Spawn Emissary\u2019s features.\n\n4. The Lesser Star Spawn Emissary does a whole bunch of stuff, like having a good number of hit points, some real solid saves that you get to keep, 120 ft truesight, some decent attacks, hover speed, and most significantly, the ability to transform into any small or medium creature at will while keeping the exact same statblock. This lets the Simulacrum turn into a beast or humanoid. Have it do that.\n\n5. Use another Wish from your Ring to cast Simulacrum on your Simulacrum, which you can do because the original is a beast or humanoid, and let the original cease to exist.\n\nYou now have a Simulacrum that has all of the features and best stats from among your original character (other than its ninth level a lot), a Soul Monger, and a Lesser Star Spawn Emissary. It can decide one d20 roll per round for only its reaction. It has truesight, a hover speed, the ability to wear heavy armor and wield a shield, 17 wizard levels, action surge, you name it.\n\nIt only has 120 hit points, which is a problem. However, Soul Monger has an ability that says that whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP, it gains temporary HP equal to that creature\u2019s hit point maximum. If you had more time, I\u2019d recommend killing a Tarrasque or something. Otherwise, you\u2019ll just have to manage to keep your god avatar alive until you can feed it a dragon or a whale or something, which shouldn\u2019t be too hard given what it can do.\n\nThis genuinely breaks the game because it can overcome almost anything your DM throws at you as long as the opponent has any chance of failure. Just fire off a save-or-suck and guarantee the suck.\n\nAlso, if your DM accidentally throws some broken homebrewed celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend at you, you can use your main character\u2019s 9th level slot to Planar Binding it and force it to fail the save with Convergent Future.

You can also be invisible in darkness, which is equivalent to permanent Greater Invisibility, a 4th level spell, as long as you stay away from light sources. Twilight gives you Eyes of Night for absurd darkvision range, which you can share with the party if they don\u2019t have darkvision (so they don\u2019t have to use a torch at night which negates your invisibility). Twilight\u2019s Vigilant Blessing and Gloomstalker\u2019s Dread Ambusher gives you an average initiative roll of ~20, which is essential for your lineage ability. You\u2019ll get WIS save proficiency from Ranger 7 at lv12, around when WIS saves become more of a concern. At Ranger 10 / lv15, you can essentially retry one missed attack per round, making you hit more reliably.\n\nLineage: Bugbear (Monsters of the Multiverse)\n- Bugbears most importantly get Surprise Attack, which is a +2d6 = ~7 damage on each attack against an enemy that hasn\u2019t taken their turn yet. The more attacks you make, the more this triggers, hence Dread Ambusher + Action Surge. Because of this, getting a higher initiative score than your target is essential.\n\nStats: 8 STR / 15 (+2) DEX / 14 CON / 10 INT / 15 (+1) WIS / 8 CHA\n\nASI/Feats:\n1.

PYF, or one from no. 3 that you didn\u2019t already pick up - Ranger 12 (Lv 18)\n- Notes: Gunner is preferred to Crossbow Expert since you\u2019ll be using Hunter\u2019s Mark for the majority of your career, which occupies your bonus action, and a d12 weapon and +1 DEX is better than one additional attack with a d6 weapon for your nova round. You\u2019ll want Gunner before Sharpshooter as until you get Precision Attack, using Sharpshooter on your nova round will actually likely decrease your damage since you\u2019re already hitting hard with Hunter\u2019s Mark and Surprise Attack. Shield will dramatically increase your survivability at the cost of your reaction which you\u2019re not likely to be using, but +2 DEX boosts your initiative, AC, attack rolls, and attack damage. Pick whatever you prefer.\n\nFighting Styles: Archery, Superior Technique\n- Notes: Archery boosts your attack, which helps negate the accuracy penalty of Sharpshooter. Superior Technique gives you an additional maneuver known and a d6 die. The d6 isn\u2019t much so use it for Goading or Trip rather than Ambush or Precision. You can also either go with Defense for +1 AC, or Blind Fighting to combo with Fog Cloud.\n\nSpells:\n- Ranger: Hunter\u2019s Mark, Absorb Elements, Goodberry, Pass Without Trace, Summon Fey (Tricksy), etc\n- Notes: Hunter\u2019s Mark is your go-to damage spell until you can pick up Summon Fey, since it adds damage per attack and you\u2019re making it rain bullets on round 1. Summon Fey (Tricksy) is usually pretty bad as its darkness bubble doesn\u2019t block darkvision like the Darkness spell, but as a gloomstalker you can go invisible in darkness so this is excellent for constant advantage + some extra damage. Since it\u2019s an action to cast but an hour duration, try to cast this before combat. If you can\u2019t, default to Hunter\u2019s Mark.\n- Cleric: Guidance, Mending, Healing Word, Detect Magic/Cure Wounds, Command, Sanctuary.\n- Notes: Your concentration is occupied, so take non-concentration spells for Cleric. You have enough WIS to make Command and Sanctuary decent, Healing Word is good for keeping people alive in combat, and you can ritually cast Detect Magic as utility. Goodberry is a better out of combat heal than Cure Wounds for a 1st level slot, but if you\u2019re fine with using a 2nd or 3rd level slot on it Cure Wounds is decent as a one Action patch-up. Guidance is always good, essentially a perma +1d4 to all skill checks as long as you aren't concentrating on another spell. RAW, you lose half your fired ammo due to them being lost or broken. If you track ammo, having mending may let you retrieve 3/4 of them rather than half by repairing the broken ones.\n\nManeuvers: Ambush, Precision Attack, Goading Attack, Trip Attack / Quick Toss.\n- Notes: Ambush helps confirm you go first if you still somehow roll bad on both dice. Precision helps you land Sharpshooter shots. Goading is better than Menacing for you since you want to, if possible, either be invisible or in the back line and behind cover, and frightened condition only works if the target can see you. With Trip Attack + Gunner, you can give yourself advantage on every attack after the first on your nova round, but be careful as this requires you to get in close and thus puts you in danger. Switch this to Quick Toss if you like or when you start using Summon Fey more than Hunter\u2019s Mark. Quick Toss lets you throw a net as a bonus action, Sharpshooter negates the disadvantage at long range (15ft). They\u2019ll have to waste an action or an attack to escape it, which is better than with Trip where they can just stand up.", "ups": 8, "depth": 0, "author": "their_teammate", "replies": [{"selftext": "Hot damn, this is very well written", "ups": 3, "depth": 1, "author": "GLaD0S213", "replies": [{"selftext": "Alright done!

Essentially it seeks to make use of the medium armor and greatsword proficiencies of the original githyanki, generally by dumping DEX and taking the Heavily Armored feat at level 4.\n\nHowever, I feel like nowadays this build would be much stronger as DEX-based instead, particularly because Tasha's would allow you to swap ability scores around and switch out the longsword and greatsword for scimitar and rapier proficiency. This is all of course assuming your DM lets you use the MTF githyanki instead of the watered-down MPMM version, which I can't imagine being a problem at most tables.\n\nEssentially start with something like 8/16/15/17/8/8 for stats, grab Resilient Constitution and Telekinetic or another +1 INT feat at the first two ASIs, and you're off to the races without having to spend a feat on +1 STR and heavy armor proficiency. Half-plate will serve you just fine, and with WIS-save proficiency and Arcane Deflection you can easily afford to dump WIS.\n\nBy going War Magic this gives you excellent initiative, and still lets you use gishy spells like the Blade cantrips, Ashardalon's Stride and Tasha's Otherworldly Guise to great effect. Yet you're not committing so hard to the gish side of things that you're a worse wizard for it, quite the contrary. You're still incredibly strong while casting control spells and the like, and can adapt to any combat scenario incredibly well.\n\nIn short, your AC and saving throws are covered, your initiative is amazing, and you get to play a very flavorful gishy character while still being a full wizard with all the power that brings and few of the drawbacks.

If we start Totem 5 with 15+2/14/13+1/8/13/9 with Dragon Hide pushing us to 18 Str at level then we can have 15 AC once we ditch Medium Armor for Monk levels. By the time you have Ascendant 3, you're one level away from 8 free breath weapons per day, and can have max Str or better yet Mobile. Tankiness won't be a huge issue in this build since Totem Barbarian just facetanks from the start. May want to pivot to Totem 6 at some point for the extra Rage if you're facing that many combats per day.\n\nIf you want to be core Monk levels, then Ascendant 5 with Mobile at level 4. Point Buy of 15+1/14/13+1/8/13+1/9. We'll have even less AC, but Mobile online pretty quickly. Levels 2 and 3 will be a bit rough. I suggest using your Ki to Disengage often during those points, but you'll have to risk being up front some rounds. No shame in using a bow if you can't hang out with the big boys long enough. From level 4 to 7 you'll be doing almost exclusively hit and run. Once Totem Bear is online you can roll the dice some more up front. I'd probably go straight to Totem 4 to bump Str, and then we could potentially cap it at Monk 8.\n\nBe sure to take proficiency in Athletics either way. Unfurled Wings, 16-18 Str, and advantage on Grapples allows us to kidnap enemies high into the skies, isolate them, pummel them, and drop em. I suggest waiting until a Multiattacking enemy (or two) begins attacking us, and then drop them after their first attack. We can let go of our grappled victims at any time. No Reaction required. If we do this perfectly, the monsters land somewhere isolated from our allies and Prone on the ground after taking Fall Damage. Far enough so that after blowing half their speed to get up, they still can't reach anyone to complete the rest of their Multiattack. They also can't Dash to get back in position because they've already used their Action. Worst case scenario, if we can't isolate from the team, we've divvied up their potential to focus fire. We can also delay the drop if they keep missing us or are hitting our healthy, resisted health pool. \n\nGive your enemies some time and breathing room. Our AC may be pretty low, but we don't want to waste what durability we have. A Mobile Monk with extra padding should offer up some flesh before they start kiting nonstop. Don't be afraid to spend a Ki point on Dodging or Disengaging once a fight in order to re-establish spacing. Mobile doesn't allow you to efficiently always back up once you've decided to plant feet for even one round.\n\nIf you want to further your Grappling career, Stars Druid 3 gets us Spike Growth, Enlarge Reduce, and Dragon Form to auto pass DC 10 concentration checks. Longstrider and Jump can also be a blast, but this won't be worth it unless we're having 5-6+ combats a day. Rage is otherwise available for potentially all of them or at least the main ones.\n\nEdit: Dragon Hide really just getting us 1 AC more isn't worth it. It's decent for a Str bump to get AC, but Crusher would be much better because we could kite with it. Also paint some enemy targets when we crit. Dragon Fear might be even more exciting. Even with 9 Cha, locking any enemies out of position before they can do something is way better than Breath Weapon damage, 1 extra AC, or Crusher if there aren't a ton of combats per day.

{"post": {"title": "War Caster is a MUST for front-line Cleric? Rant/What-can-I-do question.", "subreddit": "3d6", "selftext": "I'm interested in playing a front line Cleric. Im a new-ish player and never tried a Cleric yet. I want to keep things simple and Im not interested in multiclassing. Just looking at what I can do through level 10 or so. I'm interested in Life Cleric for the support, though Forge and War look interesting too. \n\nAnyway, I want to use a 1H and shield but I have hit a dead end when it comes to the War Caster feat. I'm trying to find a way to avoid taking it and instead just focus on ASI stat increases.\n\nLife Cleric gets heavy armor, Divine Strike, and some healing spells, restoration spells, and general party support, etc, whoch are up close touch spells. It feels like Life Clerics are intended to be near the people they are healing. The Fighters, the Paladins, the Barbarians. Also given things like Spirit Guardians that have a range of 15 feet, again it feels like they are intended to be up close.\n\nIn fact, if I don't figure out a simpler way to somehow attack, then I practically lose Divine Strike. I lose an 8th level ability. I lose class functionality.\n\nOptions that I can think of:\n\n- Use a 1H and shield and just deal with the juggling. If I use a 1H and shield, I don't have a free hand to do somatic spell casting. If I need to cast a somatic spell, I have to do this weird and awkward juggling around of my equipment and waste action economy. Or I just drop my weapon for free... but that sounds fucking dumb. Picking it back up is probably a full action anyway.\n\n- Do not use any 1H weapon. Instead, use a shield and a free hand for spellcasting. However, the wording of the War Caster feat specifically says that it opens up spellcasting for opportunity attacks. So without War Caster, I can only punch shit with my unarmed fist for 1 damage when I have an opportunity attack. I guess a 1 level dip in Fighter for CON saves, martial weapons, and unarmed fighting style? Then why not 2 level dip for the powerful Action Surge. However, I'm not really interested in multiclassing if I can avoid it. It would delay Cleric spells and my ASI by 2 levels. Again, extra steps just to do basic front-line Cleric duties and have basic opportunity attacks.\n\n\n- Use a 2H weapon so that one hand can be temporarily freed for the somatic spell casting. Life Clerics don't get martial weapons, so this will require 1 level in Fighter, or a weapon training feat. I also lose out on the AC from the shield. Though defensive fighting style cab make up for the loss of the shield. More forced multiclassing just to run at baseline. Or I make a War Domain cleric for 2H weapon proficiency but I miss out on shield AC. Fighter seems better.\n\n- Choose Variant Human and get Warcaster at level 1. I suppose this is what most people will recommend. But I was looking maybe at High Elf for a Booming Blade cantrip, or Hill Dwarf for toughness. I guess that isn't possible.\n\n\n- Give up on Life Cleric and choose a back of the line blaster domain like Arcana or Light. If I had to do this, I guess I would choose Light. But it seems like I'm selling out and giving up what I want to do.\n\n\n- Suck it up and just pay the War Caster tax. I don't have any other choice for level 4. It's an unspoken de facto requirement forced upon me.\n\nDo you know of any other options I that might help me play a single classed Life Cleric? I'm not trying to min-max a Frankenstein multiclassed blob to beat the game. I just want to be happy and play this role as intended.\n\nIf not, have any DMs out there allowed someone like me, a poor Life Cleric, to forego the somatic requirement for spells just so that I can be a Dwarf and use my measly 1H hammer and shield and use my 8th level Divine Strike without having to juggle weapon sheathing?\n\nAny advice is appreciated.", "ups": 45, "permalink": "/r/3d6/comments/16rltm2/war_caster_is_a_must_for_frontline_cleric/", "num_comments": 106}, "replies": [{"selftext": "You might want to discuss this with your GM, but a holy symbol allows you to have it mounted on or being part of your shield:\n\n&gt;Holy Symbol\"A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon.

And in many scenarios you do want to cast it again, because many of your best spells are concentration spells. Not having a concentration spell up in combat is usually a massive waste of your potential as a Cleric. Clerics are a very powerful class, but that power to a large extent depends on concentration spells like *Spirit Guardians* and *Bless\\**. The only time where you might consider not recasting a concentration spell is when the combat is already as good as won anyway and all you need to do is mop up.\n\nThis reliance on your concentration spells means that if concentration is lost, you effectively waste not only a spell slot, but also an action to recast the spell that you otherwise could have used for an attack. This sets you behind a lot in the action economy and severely reduces your contribution to a combat since you are effectively missing out on a full round of damage (and combats usually last only 3-5 rounds).\n\nMeanwhile, if you miss with a regular attack spell like *Guiding Bolt*, you also waste a spell slot but at least you are still contributing to the combat through the concentration spell you are keeping up.\n\nSo because of the value of your concentration spells, protecting your concentration as a Cleric takes priority over increasing your spellcasting modifier.\n\nAnd not only that, but taking an ASI to improve your spellcasting modifier only adds +1 to your modifier at most. Which is nice, but also doesn't make a massive difference. Sure, there are going to be cases where you fail an attack roll or an enemy succeeds their save based on 1 point difference, but it is not going to be terribly often. Concentration saves on the other hand will come up every single time you take damage (which if you are on the frontlines, will be quite frequently). And with War Caster, you can get advantage on those saves. Advantage roughly averages out to a +3 on your dice rolls. +3 is higher than +1, so the impact of this feat on your concentration rolls is comparatively bigger than that of an ASI on your other rolls.\n\nYou'll definitely want to start taking ASIs to improve your WIS at some point. But War Caster simply offers so much additional value that it is difficult to pass on (unless you are playing at high levels or have an odd CON score, in which case Resilient may provide greater benefits).

This will let you add 1d8 to your Cantrips so you don't lose out on the level 8 feature. Even then, I wouldn't worry a ton over cantrips. You'll be doing much more important things with your Action most rounds, which should *absolutely* include using the **Dodge** action. With high AC, Dodge will also help to protect your concentration when your action doesn't need to be used to cast something.\n* Opportunity attacks rarely occur (unless you take Pole Arm Master or Sentinel). They're not worth worrying about taking Warcaster over. Mostly enemies that get in melee range *want* to be in melee range and won't run away. If they do they'll likely disengage or have enough health to not worry about an Attack of Opportunity. Or the DM is just letting them panic and expecting them to die, in which case they're not a big threat anyway.\n\n**War Caster** is not what I'd recommend in general for Clerics. They're much better off with **Resilient Constitution** to get proficiency in Con saving throws. The reasons for this are:\n\n* Proficieny builds as you level, making this an increasing benefit. The numbers might work out in Warcaster's favor early on, but it switches later.\n* Protecting Concentration is important, but so are your saving throws. Constitution Saving Throws are frequently ones that you don't want to fail. Resilient Constitution covers both bases for you.\n* Warcaster gives you Advantage on concentration saving throws, but you'll be limited to a +2 to +3 modifier. When hits are less than 21 damage that's alright, but when you get hit with something that requires you to hit a number higher than 10 on the saving throw Advantage will feel less and less relevant or it might get to a point where no matter what you roll you can't possibly save. \n* Warcaster only provides advantage against concentration checks that stem from damage, but spells like [Sleet Storm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sleet-storm) or trying to maintain concentration on something like a ship in a storm can also be sources for concentration checks that Warcaster doesn't cover. How much you run into those will depend on your DM, but it's worth knowing.\n\n#General Cleric Advice\n\nHealing in 5e is not like it is in other games. You tend to not just continually dump heals into a target as they take damage. Instead heals are used to get a target off of the ground, used when that heal might help the target survive another round of attacks until they get to their turn, or used to recover health between combats when a Short Rest isn't feasible.\n\nEven with a Life Domain Cleric, that means that healing will only be a bit better. A 3rd level Cure Wounds would heal 18.5 average damage and account for half of your 3rd level spells for the day at level 5. At level 5, a Fighter will average 49 health. That's not a terrible amount of health, and might be fantastic in a pinch... but you could have used that slot for [Spirit Guardians](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spirit-guardians) to kill the enemies before they damaged him. Or [Incite Greed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/incite-greed) to keep the enemies from attacking. Or [Aura of Vitality](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/aura-of-vitality) to heal for ~70 after the combat. The point being that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nIf **Life** is the archetype that you have your heart set on and healing is what you really want to do then you've settled on the right Cleric domain, so don't let me talk you out of it. It sounds though, that you're interested in support in general which all Clerics do well. If that's the case, then what I'd most recommend is looking at the domain spell lists for the various Clerics and finding ones that include mostly spells that Clerics don't typically have access to. The more options you have the better. Some ones to look at would be:\n\n* [**Tempest Domain**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#TempestDomain) - One of the strongest AoE blasters in the game with access to some nice Druid utility spells as well.\n* [**Light Domain**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#LightDomain) - Another strong AoE blaster, especially in the early game. Decent utility at level 6 with being able to impose disadvantage to a few attacks on allies a day.\n* [**Trickery Domain**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#TrickeryDomain) - Fantastic spell options with [Pass Without Trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace), [Dimension Door](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dimension-door), and [Polymorph](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph) being big stand outs that will have a large impact on the things you can accomplish.\n* [**Grave Domain**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#GraveDomain) - One of the best Support clerics.

You can draw it next turn if you want to attack, so the only downside is that you are not threatening an Opportunity Attack that turn. (For instance, swing with your weapon, stow your weapon, and then cast Spiritual Weapon.)\n* Get the Warcaster Feat.

Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for a day.*\"\n\nGoodberry is a magic item-creation spell. It is not a healing spell that restores hit points to the creature. The action of eating the berry restores the hit points, not the spell itself. This same reasoning would also disallow Disciple of Life from boosting health potions or other consumables too.\n\nHowever, while I know that WotC supports the Life Goodberry Exploit, I don't want to do this myself. It feels like a cheap exploit. I like the idea of a Life Cleric and want to try it out. I have heard they are easy for new Cleric players, they still have access to enough powerful damage spells like Spirit Guardians like any other Cleric, and the Cleric class is strong in general.

If it helps, here is what I do when fleshing out characters.\n\nMy writings are highly thematic. I focus on a theme that I want to explore. A theme can be anything you want.\n\nFor example, Batman has a theme. Batman is more than just punches, gadgets, batarangs, etc. He is a symbol of restoration, anti-corruption, and justice. He is the coming renaissance of Gotham City. If Batman was thematically a DND character, I'd say that he is a darker version of the Oath of Redemption Paladin. He has been pushed passed the initial stages of diplomacy and is now on the path toward fighting to restore peace and protect the greater good.\n\nPaladins are actually very thematic now that I'm looking at their tenets. The tenets of their oaths are good examples of what I'm getting at.\n\nThe theme doesn't have to be incredibly philosophical. It can be anything that is interesting or important to you. Then everything your character does and what happens to them are all related to their theme. Their goals, flaws, strengths, etc, are all specific examples of the theme. They illustrate the theme.\n\nOn illustrating the theme: if Batman symbolizes restoration, then his goals must be about restoring Gotham. His job would be much simpler if he just killed all his enemies on sight rather than capture them alive and bring them to justice. But Batman sticks to his goals and his theme. He is there to save, not to kill. Gotham won't be a good city if violence begets violence. (Although I think in some comic runs, he actually does kill some people... not an expert in all versions, though). That is what drives his actions and explains why he acts the way he does. He is a savior archetype, not a vengeful archetype.\n\nThe same thing with consequences and character flaws. They should be related to the character's theme. Batman is always taking dangerous risks, he is always exhausted, doesn't sleep, and is very lonely. That's what it costs. The only person close to him, Alfred, is constantly reminding him of the consequences of being Batman. You can draw inspiration from the theme to come up with character flaws.\n\nWith the theme, goals, and flaws as starting points, you can build anything from there. Personality traits -- think of how a person would act given their goals. Character development -- their flaws and challenges will be struggles they learn from and adapt themselves to over time. Background -- how are they tied to the theme? Where did they first come up with their goals? Why do they care about their goals? They had to come from somewhere.\n\nThemes can make your character feel like they actually have a purpose for being there. Sort of like they are tied to some greater purpose. The characters are there to explore some thematic message you are interested in. Another benefit: everything about them is consistent because it always ties back to the core theme. It's not just \"lol, random personality quirk for giggles\"... unless randomness or chaos is your theme. Sort of like the Joker.\n\nAnyway, analyzing themes is a lot of fun to me and it is easy to ramble. I'll stop here. No more Batman.\n\nTry this out and see if you like it, but don't force it if it doesn't work for you. Nothing is worse than not having fun but still forcing yourself.

Internalize it and externalize it. \n\nThe only other thing I'd add is that Batman notoriously works alone.

Their class builds, backstories, and the monsters they fight often reflect that conflict.\n\nHere's my process. It might seem really complicated but to me it's simple.\n\n1. **Pick a theme** such as family, matrescence, kleptomania, autonomy, beauty, abandonment, etc. This might be inspired by a build idea, backstory idea, race, etc. If you have something in mind, ask yourself \"what are the themes here?\"\n2. **Play with** [Dan Harmon's Story Circle](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit) to get an idea of your arc. I fucking love this tool and use it A LOT. Obviously you can't control exactly how things go or even the big story beats, that may fall to your DM and the dice, but at least try to figure out what your PC's \"zone of comfort\" is and what it is they \"want\". I see it as the Players job to start the circle and end the circle, while the DM sort of creates the \"unfamiliar situations\", \"trials\", and to extract a price. There are other frameworks you can use for stories but this is my favorite and I always come back to it.\n3. **Pick personality traits, accents, and little details that accent your theme**. For my family PC, as an example, I choose a subclass that let them journey with their little brother (my friend's homebrew fighter \"pet class\" that gives a squire). She had a Scouse accent because I find it wholesome. They were halflings because they're a bit of underdogs and it is a story about how \"what makes us strong is that we stick together\". She calls her dad every day via a sending stone. She loves adventuring but had some anxiety about the risks for her brother\u2014it makes her protective and she always double checks everyone has plenty of health potions in a spot that's easy to find. She tends to put herself in harms way for her brother, but her brother does the same back, so they often end up creating their own worst nightmares because they are selfless but also protective.\n4. **Look for monsters that personify your inner struggle.** Who is the villain in The Hobbit? Most would say Smaug. I'd say it's their own pride and greed. They fight Smaug, defeat him, but that's not the end of the story. The real fight is when they face themselves. The thing that kills more of the party than Smaug is the War of the Five Kings that follows. It's the dwarves own pride and greed. If your theme is autonomy, give your PC a villian such as an Archfey that charms and dominates people that has the autonomy that your PC desires but at the cost of other people's autonomy. If your theme is abandonment, give your PC a villain that is Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, a creature that feels their same pain at having been tossed aside.\n\n**Bonus (for accents):**\n\nI often build \"accent sheets\" which give me reminders of the features of my character's accent. Not just their dialect, but phrases they might say, words they might prefer, etc. I got this trick from a professional voice over actor who did cartoons.\n\nSo my beautiful and polite noble archfey's sheet is more-or-less two pages that reminds me how to do a Mary Poppin's accent. She's very illustrative and poetic and tends to use more words than necessary. She might say, \"Thank you very much for this lovely honor\" or \"Oh my, you passed a test with such flying colors!\"\n\nMy family-oriented fighter \"es always on abou' 'me mum' an 'me dad', yah really can' get he' tah shut up abou' et.\"\n\nI sort notes based on social situations like, \"negative responses\", \"positive responses\", \"romantic quips\", \"teases\", \"stealth missions\", \"combat phrases\", etc.\n\nSo again, for the fighter there is this section:\n\n&gt;**Statements of negativity**  \n\\- I'm gutted  \n\\- Are you messin?  \n\\- Fucks sake!  \n\\- Jus\u2019 lemme do me job, yeah?- You're pullin' me leg?  \n\\- Bird, are you havin' a laugh?\n\nI usually give these a review before the session as a reminder of their voice.", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "4tomicZ", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "General skeleton and fill it out as I go.

At level 3 it's very likely that you're still fighting things like Bandits, Goblins, Giant spiders and low level monsters in general. Imagine an encounter with 7 goblins, like the ones you can find in Lost Mines of Phalvender at this level. A goblin has 7HP, so there's 3 things that might happen:\n\n1-You cast Hunter's Mark and you very likely kill one each time you hit, in exchange for your bonus action each round to cast it on the each of the Goblins.\n\n2-You don't cast Hunter's Mark, you hit It normally and you still kill It because you're doing 1d6+3, so you have your bonus action free to attack a different Goblin.\n\n3-You don't cast, don't do enough damage to kill the Goblin, but you still can attack it with your bonus action killing it.\n\nSo here there's little incentive to use Hunter's Mark. And even with things with a tad more HP like Bandits and Orcs you'll realize that it's still not necessary, as your party is there doing damage and likely focusing fire. So any monster with less than 20HP isn't likely to survive until your next turn.\n\nOn the contrary, let's say you're fighting something with more HP. In the same module and at the same level you might fight an Owlbear, wich has 59HP. Let's assume the fight last 3 rounds. You attack 5 times with Hunter's Mark. As the Owlbear has 13AC you'll hit 3 of those attacks on average, so Hunter's Mark has gotten you 3d6 of extra damage. The average of 3d6 is 10'5 points of extra damage, wich isn't bad for a level 1 spell. But you could have attacked with your bonus action in the first round. That attack does 6'5 damage on average, so Hunter's mark has only gotten you 4 points of damage for a level 1 spellslot. So even in this example, the casting of Hunter's Mark is questionable as the extra damage isn't likely to make a difference in the outcome of the fight, while keeping that Spellslot around for healing spells like Cure Wounds or Goodberry might.\n\nHunter's Mark is easy to use, and it seems really good at low levels, but it only trully makes sense in a fight against a damage sponge.

I like playing the bard as a support caster with lots of out of combat utility through spells and skills (especially in social situation or through enchantment/illusion spells). As I sometimes take the spotlight in these situations, I like to help my group members shine in the situations they wanna take the spotlight in (including but not limited to combat.) So I am usually very much having fun and be active in roleplay heavy sessions or high stakes combat situations as I play my character, interact with the group and juggle buff and debuff spells and inspiration. However there are sessions leading up to the big bossfights, where there is a lot of low-stakes combat where I feel like using my limited spellslots is kinda wasted and in that case it usually comes down to becoming a vicious mockery bot.\n\nSo my question is: Do any of you have some ideas on how to still contribute somewhat in these combats aside from vicious mockery or an underwhelming attack? It would be great if they didn't take too much investment, maybe a feat or an uncommon magic item. This is for a new character, so feel free to suggest certain subclasses that help with that without infringing too much on the support role. Uncommon magic items are also ok. Multiclassing only if it helps beyond fixing the \"problem\". I get that \"Having nothing to do, when the combat is so easy, that I don't need to do anything special\" is a very \"not really a problem\" problem to have but the way we play, some sessions are nothing else and I just feel a little disconnected.\n\nI had some ideas myself, but for the sake of not making this post even longer, I will not list them all and discuss them in the comments if someone suggests them.\n\nI am thankful for any suggestion.

Character has proficiency or even somehow expertise in Persuasion but their backstory is literally like those Hollywood prop towns with only the front built, so don't expect them to use their social skill proficiencies to engage with your world in any way. May have a romantic partner way out of their league, but otherwise both the character and player have no connection to any living family as far as you can tell.

They will stop to investigate every NPC, back alley, side room, and city. Powering through an indecipherable accent, they will force roleplay moments on an unsuspecting party.

They are *great*. They've bought the book. They read the rules. They see the Plot Cleric's bi pin and invited them to a queer book club (this invitation is promptly refused).

Maybe they grew up religious?

So instead, I shall share the build I've come up with that I intend to build next time I play in a group that needs a frontliner.\n\nFor race, we're going MotM Orc. 15+2/14/15+1/8/10/8 for the stat line, although shift the mental stat 10 wherever you like. Barbarian first level, whatever background you want, just make sure you pick up the Athletics skill proficiency somewhere.\n\n Your first few levels are a little rough if you're sticking to unarmed only; 4 damage with punches regular, 6 when raging. You can just pick up a greataxe and start swinging like a regular old barbie, but I like thematically sticking to just your hands. I picture an orcish version of Ryu from Street Fighter, just traveling the globe with nothing but your Karate gi and a small bag with your bedroll and rations slung over your shoulder.\n\nLevel 3, Totem barbarian, BUT WAIT, we're not running bear totem. We're going to be toit like a toiger, and go for the Tiger spirit, granting us sizeable 10 feet to our long jump and a wee 3 feet to our high jump distance while raging.\n\nLevel 4, the build comes online in multiple ways, when we grab Tavern Brawler. You can now punch for 1d4+4, when you punch someone you can grapple as a bonus action, but most importantly for the this level, your strength is now 18. Combined with the 3 feet from Tiger spirit, you have the magic number of a 10 foot high jump.\n\n\"At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\"\n\nNow we go to why we picked the noble Orc as our race; powerful build. Because of it your carrying capacity is 540lb, so assuming you have stuck to your ascetic belongings you could comfortably carry the heaviest lineman in the NFL, wearing full plate armour and carrying a set of weapons. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc8njGBO71U&amp;ab\\_channel=LeagueofLoL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc8njGBO71U&amp;ab_channel=LeagueofLoL)\n\nThis video is your bread and butter. Turn one, rage, run 10 feet towards your foe, and unleash your grapple. You have advantage and a plus 6 modfier, should be comfortable to beat humanoids around your level here. Bring them on a journey with you 10 feet into the air, then cackle maniacally or throw out your WWE catchphrases as you and your victim collide with the floor, taking 1d6 damage (which you resist) and both go prone. \n\nBecause your foe is grappled, they can't stand up so you are both stuck prone until your next turn or if they have some way of getting out via magic or muscle. Either way, spell resource expenditure and/or action economy loss on their end.\n\nFrom this point on while your rage persists, your action will be to throw a punch and then bonus action to grapple something in hugging distance. Stand up following slamming someone to the floor, keep them in place and force disadvantage on all their attacks while pummelling them at advantage.\n\nLevel 5, you get your extra attack and an extra 10 foot move speed, meaning if you start your turn raging and 10 feet away from a target, you can run up and sucker punch them in the head, pick them up, slam both of yourselves down, then stand up and punch them in the head again at advantage.\n\nAt level 6 we are picking bear spirit for doubling carrying capacity. For context, your character could now rush an American Football offensive line, pick up the two biggest dudes, one in each arm, then jump while carrying them both over a foot higher than the high jump world record. \n\nAt this point, you make a minor choice; if you are frequently coming across foes too big for even you to carry, pick up 4 levels in fighter first. Otherwise, get Barbarian to 8 before dabbling in fighter levels. We'll go with the latter for simplicity.\n\n7 Barbarian gives you a bit more speed on the turn you rage as well as some initiative bonuses. \n\n8 Gives you +2 STR for 20 str.\n\nSide note, the uncommon rarity item Boots of Striding and Springing triple your jump height, letting you do the big showstopper even when not raging (although beware of fall damage no longer being halved) or allowing your new jump height to reach the 3d6 damage mark of 33ft.\n\nFighter levels now; first level grab unarmed fighting style to make your punches deal 1d8+STR, as well as choke a creature you're grappling at the start of your turn for 1d4 bonus damage.\n\nLevel 3, we're going Rune Knight, giving you some snazzy rune magic as well as the ability to get BIGGER to pick up bigger stuff with another doubling of your carrying capacity. Little bit of bonus action overlap but is what it is.\n\n4, Bump up the CON.\n\nI won't detail the rest of it but for the rest I recommend going for 16 Barbarian. Max your CON and take whatever feat you want to round it out (my go to is Tough), at 14 Barb get Eagle totem for the ability to fly (on your turn) to do some fun stuff with picking up and putting down.\n\nLevel 20 you have 281 hit points, 17 AC, +11 to hit with a 1d8+5 damage base, not including rage bonuses or giants might. While bigger, you can Showstopper two grizzly bears at once, or push, pull or drag a Toyota Corolla.

You really only need a CHA score of 18 for this build, since abusing Elven Accuracy advantage will make it easier to hit, and you\u2019ll be dealing more than enough damage as is. \n\nFor invocations, pick the 4 Blade Pact options: improved pact weapon, thirsting blade, lifedrinker, and eldritch smite. Also recommend Agonizing Blast for good ranged damage, as well as Repelling Blast and Lance of Lethargy for crowd control shenanigans with AoE save-or-suck spells. \n\nFor your 9th level MA, pick Foresight. This is VITAL for the build, since it frees up your concentration to use on other spells (or to blow through more smite slots). For 8th level, a good area control spell like maddening darkness would be good (if you choose MD, pick the Devil Sight invocation). For 7th level, Forcecage is probably your best bet. For 6th level, I recommend either Eyebite, Tasha\u2019s Otherworldly Guise, or Circle of Death, depending on what you want for the build. I would pick Circle of Death for massive crowd control capabilities (something lacking in this build) but both of the other options could also be good. \n\nSpells 5th level and below don\u2019t matter too much, but I recommend Banishing Smite, Synaptic Static, Counterspell, Hold Person, and Hold Monster. We\u2019re mostly gonna be using those slots for Eldritch Smite though, so don\u2019t worry yourself too much. \n\nSince foresight takes a full minute to cast, you should cast it in advance of combat but not right at the end of a rest, unless you think combat is imminent. Once that\u2019s up, the build is fully operational. (If you pick the Metamagic Adept feat, you can extend the spell\u2019s duration to 16 hours, essentially lasting the entire length of the day)\n\nAgainst a single target, you should attack with your pact weapon as often as you can, using Eldritch Smite only on crits (and using a power attack feature on every attack, if you have it from Sharpshooter or GWM). Hexblade\u2019s Curse it ASAP, and your chances of a crit are very high, and will increase even more if you choose PAM\u2019s bonus action attack, but monsters at this level can be scary. \n\nSpells will primarily be used to handle large crowds of enemies.

Now, you\u2019re unlikely to find a Fork + 1 or Spoon + 1 (but totally dependent on your DM).

After you slam your book into an unsuspecting opponent\u2019s face, Tavern Brawler allows you to grapple as a Bonus Action.  And the Hex spell can give your opponent disadvantage on Strength or Dexterity checks that they may need to escape your grapple.

In other words the AC difference will only matter if youre a high ac frontline fighter. Who wont typically have access to polymorph. And even if you are a frontliner, you have to be fighting specifically against enemies which are solely reliant on attacks for damage. Even with all that in mind, it only makes a difference if the enemies have a low enough attack bonus that they miss a significant number of attacks against said frontliner. \n\nAnd then, even with all that in mind, its still a massive pool of hp for a mid level spell slot, and the spell scales with player level rather than spell slot level. \n\nAnd then, as if all that wasnt enough, it provides access to utilities like flight, swim, climb, or burrow speed, as well as potentially things like tremorsense and blindsight.\n\nOh and also most Beasts in specific are designed to be weaker and less threatening by CR specifically to make one spell more \"balanced\", further throwing off the already wonky and inconsistent monster design of the game.", "ups": 3, "depth": 5, "author": "Burnside_They_Them", "replies": [{"selftext": "Your first statement is purely anecdotal evidence, but regarding the specific arguments you have presented:\n\n1.

It does a lot more than that, but even if that was all it did, thats still above and beyond any other spell for its level by a long shot.\n\n&gt;Hypnotic Pattern, Web, Plant Growth, Sleet Storm etc. \n\nAll of these are save based, and fairly easy to resist or counter. Of all of these i think the only ones ive ever seen actually used effectively are Hypnotic Pattern and Web, and neither of those are hard to counter. Admittedly setting Webs on fire is a very fun combo. But it at least takes some doing, rather than just \"I hit the endless HP button\".\n\n&gt;2. Scaling with player level rather than spell level doesn't matter because the highest CR any beast in official content has is 8.\n\nSo it only matters up to level 8? Ah yes, just the main portion of the game that people actually play (fun fact, thats something we actually have statistics on). And then theres the matter of True Polymorph. And the matter of \"I better never make a beast over CR 8 or my entire game breaks even more, for the sake of a spell that just doesnt need to be this strong\".\n\n&gt;3.

Do you have evidence for the Beast creature type being specifically made weaker for its CR with this one spell in mind?\n\nThat was your implication, but yes i have noticed that Beasts tend to get absolutely destroyed effortlessly compared to other creatures of their cr in most encounters i use them in. No i cant prove that its because of this spell, but i dont see why else they would be so much weaker. The sad part is its a moot effort because even with that you basically cant lose a battle if you have one or more people with polymorph, unless the dm has npcs with Dispell Magic prepared, or npcs that deal so much damage they absolutely shred through any party that isnt using polymorph or some ridiculously optimized tank build.\n\n\nAlso it almost completely invalidates Wildshape as a feature (unless your playing a druid subclass that focuses on improving wildshape)", "ups": 1, "depth": 7, "author": "Burnside_They_Them", "replies": [{"selftext": "Once again, anecdotes aren't evidence. \n\nPlant growth requires no save, Sleet Storm and Web screw over enemies regardless of whether they succeed.

Honestly this sounds like you play with parties that don't have optimized casters, in which case Poly certainly might seem more useful due to having a high skill floor.\n\nThe expected \"all hits damage\" of a CR 7 monster is 45-50 per the DMG, casting an AoE shutdown spell like those I mentioned will often prevent significantly more damage than 83-104.\n\nAlso, you literally get 4th-level slots at level 7, scaling \"up to level 8\" means scaling for one level only. It stops going up before you reach 5th level slots.\n\nTrue polymorph is a broken spell of course, the creatures you get to choose there have innate spellcasting and all manner of weird abilities that break the game like a metallic dragon's Change Shape. But that's not relevant for the Polymorph spell.\n\nThe opportunity cost of those utility options is not casting a better spell with your spell slot.\n\n\"Can't lose a battle\" is also a serious overstatement, no serious encounter will get stomped by one single Polymorph. It's best used as an emergency button to save someone who's almost dead, although if you were concentrating on a good control spell already then dropping it would worsen your party's chances of survival.\n\nYour last argument is again anecdotal.

Weapon and armor restrictions: although you\u2019re proficient with medium armor and shields as an artificer, you\u2019ll need to use light armor, no shield, and you\u2019ll be capped at a pistol since you can\u2019t attack with a weapon in two hands and still bladesong. \n\n2. General MAD-ness: because we\u2019re planning on using artillerist (not battle smith) and want to make weapon attacks and use our turret, we\u2019ll be forced to split our stats between DEX and INT. I recommend prioritizing DEX, so your INT might sit at 16 for a while.\n\n3. Chosen artificer subclass: because we want to be making attacks with our action and use our bonus action to fire the turret, we have little to no use for the higher level features of artillerist.

CON would be 14. We can somewhat ignore gunner till later since we already have firearm proficiency from being an artificer and can use a cantrip for one of our attacks at bladesinger 6 (getting around the loading issue) until level 8 where we can have a repeating shot infusion pistol. For this reason, I\u2019d take sharpshooter at wizard 4. \n\nAt wizard 8 I\u2019d take gunner (or another DEX half feat). Wizard 12 would be +2 DEX -&gt; 20.

Everything the Bard does is usually separate from their spells, whereas every other caster does stuff differently.

New   Player will likely have the good sense to note the difference in purpose between the a few of the options: Defense for AC and concentration protection, Dueling / GWF for proper weapon focus, or even Blessed Warrior to properly lean into Spellcasting. \n\nWith Divine Sense, Channel Divinity, and Lay on Hands, and later on Cleansing Touch if you go that far, New Player will have have tools in their kit to handle problems, along with the dilemma of whether to use these or to expend a spell slot as an alternative.

The Paladin only goes up to 5th level spells if pure-classed, which puts more responsibility on the player to conserve their slots. They are a prep caster, which lets them try out new spells regularly to see what works for them. No ritual casting here, but that\u2019s a simple next step. Then comes our dearly beloved Divine Smite. Some casters have alternatives for spending slots than spells (example: Drakewarden Ranger, Scribes Wizard) and Paladin is no exception. This option lets New Player experiment with \u201cgoing nova\u201d (spending several slots to whittle down an important target quickly), but just as importantly it may prompt New Player to ask: \u201cwhat is the best use of this slot?\u201d\n\nAll in all, Paladin comes with many bullet points, works with the player\u2019s new habits and pitfalls, and can play with simplicity or complexity as your player wishes.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "nshields99", "replies": []}]}

Find Familiar only has to be recast when the familiar dies, or when you want to change its form - most likely neither of those come up more than once per day.\n\nEldritch Knight int - you dont *have to* raise your int as an eldritch knight. Depending on the spells you choose, you can even function with 8 int pretty reliably.

Usually you need an empty hand to do it.\n\nMaterial can be pretty much anything. What it is its not important, what it represents is. You need either a component pouch, or a focus. Component pouch is the easier of the two. Its just a satchel that has everything your spells need, if they dont have a gold cost (like booming blade), and the spell doesnt consume it. If a spell's description says \"rotten bull teststicles in a jar\", your component pouch will have it. All that matters is that you reach into your pocket, take out the jar, cast the spell, then put the jar away.\n\nFocus is usually a staff or a wand. Their function is to replace to component pouch. You dont have to reach into your pocket to take out the jar, but you have to hold the wand.\n\nWeirdness Number 1. If a spell has both a material and a somatic component, the same hand that is holding the material component can perform the somatic as well. For an eldritch knight, it means that you have a shield in one of your hands, the other hand is empty. Your empty hand reaches into your pockets, takes out the jar, you start shaking the jar like maracas, you cast the spell, and you put the jar away. If you have a shield and a wand, you start waving the wand around and you cast the spell.\n\nWeirdness Number 2. Focuses are dumb. They for some reason recognize when a spell needs material component. If the spell doesnt, the focus doesnt work. Rules as Written, the focus can only substitute for the M component, if the spell has one. Meaning if the spell doesnt have an M component, but has a S component, you need your other hand to do it. For most casters this isnt a problem, because they have an empty hand.\n\nYou however, want to play an eldritch knight, that has a shield. An eldritch knight cant use focuses by default, however there are ways to make your weapon count as a focus. The problem is, that is not enough. You have a shield in one hand, your focus in another, and yo uare attacked. Because the Shield spell doesnt have an M component, the focus does not find anything to substitue, it doesnt count as a hand that can do the waving. Meaning, if you have a sword and a shield, you cant cast Shield. You cant cast Absorb Elements. You cant cast Burning Hands.

I think it works fine RAW so long as you're firing Magic Stones from a Sling. \n\nThe only reason it could be good though is if the DM injects some QoL to it. Like they don't mind you spamming the cantrip outside of combat so that we have stones locked and loaded prior to round 1. Another possible scenario is if they allow for a pre-buff ability at times, but there is a Verbal component to this spell. \n\nGetting to cast Faerie Fire/Web/Spike Growth and BA Quick Toss a Stone all on round 1 would be pretty nuts. While this is doable with Action Surge, Maneuvers are much more readily available. I'm sure there will be other rounds where we might want to combine another Action with a Quick Toss rather than reloading with Magic Stone. Enough that it could make for a pretty exciting multiclass.\n\nAmbush is the next pick as it's amazing for a control/buff/debuff based caster which we are. \n\nBait and Switch/Evasive Footwork are decent for us. I'd probably go with B&amp;S as it's potentially just as good as Evasive Action in terms of adding to our defense, but has a lot more options than just booking it and rolling the dice. It'd be particularly nice if we could swap with a melee ally attacking from 10ft reach, and we're sandwiched in a conga line with them and an enemy. They can step in, we can get our breathing room back, and the extra AC can go towards whoever needs it most. Probably the pole user.\n\nCommander's Strike has solid potential if we land our first attack since applying Gathered Swarm is the most important thing. An off round Sneak Attack would be extra clutch if it finishes off an enemy threatening us in melee, then we can back up, and get a clean shot off as well. \n\nAssuming we don't have much Cha, Tactical Assessment may be the last one to consider. Insight checks can be pretty pivotal. I'd consider this one especially if there's some days where there's hardly/if any combat. If History or Investigation checks come up enough like at most tables, there's no harm in pressing your luck and if you get a decent roll you'd go a solid boost to throw behind it. Knowledge is power, and so are magic items.\n\nSwarmkeeper and Ranger scales well though so don't feel forced to continue Fighter this soon. I'd probably continue to Action Surge and BM 3 eventually, but maybe secure the flight from Writhing Tide, another ASI to cap Wis or boost concentration further, and get to Conjure Animals.

You can Barbarian up to level 5 and then go Rogue 15.  This will immediately get you another proficiency and 2 skill expertises at 6th level.  There's nothing making you take Stealth or Thieves Tools.  Go ahead and take Athletics and History, Religion, or Medicine...Any skills you want.

Kenku is my 'smart' build go to because Kenku's recall  gives Advantage on those Expertise rolls (prof bonus x per day).  Gnomes also make great Barbarian Rogues for the Advantage on saves vs INT, WIS, CHA and Rock Gnomes get Artificer's Lore for another sort of expertise.  Dwarves also get a pseudo Expertise.

If you can put your abilities anywhere, go Hill Dwarf or Goliath.  If not, go Wood Elf or High Elf.  I think you still want a DEX build.  Don't get me wrong, going Plate and Shield, with Defense and Shield spell is really nice, but if you want an optimized EK, you want Crossbow Expert and Sharpshooter.  You can start off using Heavy Crossbow or Longbow and have a Rapier and Shield or two Short Swords.  Take the Archery Fighting style.   At level 4 grab Crossbow Expert.

Requires 13 wisdom and int to do though.\n2. Artificer 1/Wizard X.  Similar to the above build, this gives you armor proficiency, access to some healing, and the artificer spells use int.  Not quite as good IMO, but you don't need 13 wisdom.\n3. Bladesinger Wizard.  This gives you extra attack and tanky goodness as long as you have bladesong up.\n4. Bardlock.  Play Lore Bard X with a two level dip in hexblade warlock.  This gives you shield and armor proficiency, agonizing blast, etc.  Use your Lore Bard secrets to get necromancy goodness.  If you want extra attack, you can get it by taking 3 more warlock levels.\n5. If you must do EK, then EK 7/ War Wizard 13 is pretty solid, but not quite as good as a Paladin 6/Sorcerer IMO.\n\nRace wise consider Hill Dwarf for the extra health (especially recommended for the first option).

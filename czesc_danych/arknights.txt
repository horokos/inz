(or well it is possible but takes 6 months or so. when limited banners are every 3 months)\n\n\n\nSaving for future limit3ds is a good thing. but 300 is only done for the guarantee/sparking an older unit. which for most limiteds is not worth it at all.", "ups": 1, "depth": 4, "author": "DARKawp", "replies": [{"selftext": "\n\nHey! Sorry if I don't understand correctly, so why isn't it good to save for a spark on limiteds?

Maybe even at best if one uses premium currency and somehow isn't interested in skins. 50 ish pulls per month.\n\n\nEssentially, 300 pulls are at least 6 months to 8 months worth of F2P income. and spending it on 1 specific banner for a spark means you have to skip a ton of banners with actual good units.\n\n\nBut the thing is that on that journey, you pull a ton of dupes (dupes are not impactful at all in Arknights) and spend essentially way too much.\n\n\ndoesn't help that limiteds come out quicker, then an F2P can spark them, so unless you are lucky in free pulls consistently. one can not \"catch up\" on the limited unit stuff. even if one can, it would take years.\n\nAlso, most limiteds kinda are mid? besides some notable exceptions. even then, the notable exceptions can be borrowed from friends if needed.\n\nAnd just an account due to that above fact will be fine without them.\n\n\nof course, if you look at future banners and the limiteds that are rated up (a.k.a the new limited releasing then) interests you then saving and getting them can be good. (since afterwards, they cost 300 pulls and or 0.04% chance/luck)\n\nOut of the 12 currently our limiteds on global:\n\nNian, W , Rosmontis and Dusk are either bad or just too niche to see realistic use.\n\nSkalter, Chen the holungday, Texas the omertosa are good overal and meta. (High damage or being extremely good supportive AFK unit)\n\n\nNearl the radiant knight is a strong unit overal but mostly for higher difficulty or high dodge stuff.\n\nGavial the invincible, Specter the unchained and chongue  are good but again other non limtieds can do similar things. (Besides Abysal hunter squads with Specter alter but that is a niche/specific strat)\n\n\nLing is also good, but again, she is known for her solo clears. for which again one can just get a maxed out ling from a friend via the support unit function.\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, none of them are necessary, and even if one is good enough to see use in a strat, you do. you just loan them from a friend.\n\nNone of these even the meta ones are arguebly worth the value of 300 damn pulls on 1 banner. Especially when many Non limited units exist that are similarly powerful and much easier to acquire.\n\n\nalso never try for an old limited unless you got 300. since again 0.04% chances are like 1/2500 chance. a.k.a extremely low.", "ups": 1, "depth": 6, "author": "DARKawp", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "It's really only worth it if *you* decide you want someone.

It's far better doing this than to be told you should spark someone because otherwise you won't have an attachment to them nor know what they're like in gameplay.

{"post": {"title": "Arknights Fandom Wiki will move to a new platform!", "subreddit": "arknights", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm NikitaReiYui, the head administrator of the Arknights Fandom Wiki.\n\nSome of you might have wondering why the wiki is on the Fandom platform which is recently known for its slew of problems and controversies. Well, that's because the Fandom platform is the one I'm familiar with; I started dabbling on the wiki in the Mental Omega APYR Wiki and managed to built it into good shape before getting into Arknights around early 2020 where I noticed the existence of the Arknights Fandom Wiki, which is in a bad shape when I started editing for the wiki. It takes me a while to improve the wiki from the ground up and I ended up becoming its bureaucrat, and has since devoted my time and passion to make the wiki a good source of information for Arknights players, covering the niches which other wikis such as Gamepress didn't.\n\nWhile I am very well aware of Fandom's issues, I continued working on it because of familiarity and responsibility to provide accurate, up-to-date information about Arknights. However, the issues start to take toll on the wiki's popularity, and thus I have decided to consider a grand decision to migrate the Arknights Fandom Wiki into a new platform.\n\nThis decision is currently being discussed in the wiki's Discord server, but it will assuredly be carried out once a consensus is made. Currently the server is in favor of moving the wiki's platform, but we have yet to decide where to move the wiki; the editors are currently discussing this, and we will let everyone know which platform the wiki will be moved to when it is decided. If everything went smoothly, we would carry out the migration in October and complete it in November; until then, the old wiki will continue to be updated.\n\nI hope that this decision will allow Arknights Wiki to remain a reliable, accurate, and up-to-date source of information for Arknights players, especially in matters that the other AK wiki does not cover such as lore, and making things better to come.\n\nIf you have opinions or suggestions regarding this decision, don't be shy to voice them here.\n\nThat's all from me, NikitaReiYui, and see you on the new platform!", "ups": 419, "permalink": "/r/arknights/comments/16sd9pa/arknights_fandom_wiki_will_move_to_a_new_platform/", "num_comments": 51}, "replies": [{"selftext": "This is sick!

As was mentioned by another comment, a lot of gachas (the majority from what I observed) have sweeps and instant claim functions, which makes staying on top of energy as easy as tapping once.\n\nAK is ironically one of the more demanding gachas in terms of how much objective time you spend on just clearing energy and managing the base, and is exacerbated by the fact that you have to sign in twice a day to stay on top of energy. But, since AK has an auto function, you can still use that time more efficiently by playing or doing something else concurrently. \n\nLimbus Company, however, takes less than a minute to stay on top of each day, and only takes meaningful time once per week to clear out your 3 MD bonuses. I have no idea how those 2 games are eating 30 mins a day for you, unless you're spending a lot of time hemming and hawing over who to develop.\n\nThat hearkens back to my last point though: the reason it can be so demanding handling so many games at once is that you need to remember what you were doing and why in *all* of them every day. That's a lot of junk eating up space in your brain, and your emotional investment in any one game sharply declines from splitting your attention so much.

No one ever suggests that such a power exists.\n\nWith that said, Andoain has two scenarios:\n\n# The Pope Disagrees\n\nAndoain fails to convince the pope to change his governing policies, so he murders the pope with his Guardian Gun and becomes a fallen angel.\n\nIf the pope's returning guards do not kill Andoain, the furious and panicking populace will. In the panic and outrage, the people of Laterano would probably hunt down and kill every Pathfinder they can find.\n\nIf any of the foreign guests attending the internal conference are harmed, it could become a 'cause for war' with the other nations.\n\nAt the end of it all, the Laterano people (or its government) chooses a new pope who will be anxious to avoid being assassinated, and the people (and other government officials) are going to expect tighter controls to avoid such a thing happening again.\n\nI cannot see any other way for this scenario to play out, and certainly no way for it to achieve anything the Pathfinders want, or anything Andoain wants except spiteful satisfaction.\n\nIt's not until after learning the truth of the Law and having Fiammetta's unhealthy obsession reignite his own conviction, that Andoain finally realizes what he should have done when the pope said \"No\" is just LEAVE and go BUILD a new Laterano.\n\nWith ~~blackjack and hookers~~ Sarkaz and half-breeds!\n\n# The Pope Agrees\n\nAndoain successfully convinces the pope that Laterano needs to do more than host international conferences to try and build peaceful connections between the competing empires and nations of the world.\n\nBut what exactly did Andoain want Laterano to do?\n\nDid he simply want the government to devote public property and taxpayer money towards providing Temporary Emergency Relief Aid to citizens of other nations in response to natural disasters?\n\nDid Andoain want to pay for this foreign aid by cutting budgets to the existing government agencies, or increasing the people's taxes?\n\nDid he only want the government to inform the people of foreign crisis situations and organize donation drives, so that the people would voluntarily offer charity to the needy?\n\n# Agrees 2: The Absurd Extreme\n\nCertainly, Andoain couldn't think that Laterano should go so far as to systematically subsidize other nations.\n\nBefore the Profound Silence ruined his Iberian village, the Iberian Empire was experiencing its Golden Age. They used the unmatched naval technology afforded to them by the Islander Aegirians to plunder the rest of the world, enriching the Iberian nobility through plunder and conquest. Iberia began the long suffering of Bolivia, kicking that nation down so that it would be an easy victim for Leithania and Columbia in the future.\n\nAfter the Profound Silence, the Iberian nobility left the coastal villages to rot and starve. The Inquisition provided no aid to these people, and only executed any peasants caught stealing from 'their betters'.\n\nEmpires and feudal ruling classes, as a rule, take as much as they can from everyone else to enrich themselves. By war or by taxation. No amount of wealth is ever enough for an empire; imperial conquest is always about taking more.\n\nIberia, Victoria, Ursus, Leithania, Kazimierz... all of them would all gladly let Laterano spend as much as it could to help their peasants.\n\nThat just lets the rulers tax the peasants even more.", "ups": 74, "permalink": "/r/arknights/comments/16rx65r/so_what_was_andoains_plan/", "num_comments": 63}, "replies": [{"selftext": "It's an ideal.

But the crafting looks like it\u2019s going further and further. Imagine when the story starts getting really far into the chapters, if the system continues.\n\nImplementing a system to fix it is very possible, but I also know they want to give people an incentive to go through story.\n\nI don\u2019t think this system is the end of the world, some might see it as a challenge and not bother others.

{"post": {"title": "I don't understand Laterano's exile policy for the Infected", "subreddit": "arknights", "selftext": "While there are some [issues on which I'll defend Laterano](https://www.reddit.com/r/arknights/comments/16piz85/the_city_of_angels/), or at least argue that people should consider their perspective, I can't defend them on this one.\n\nLaterano has no apparent reason to be ignorant to how hard it is for the Infected to infect others.\n\nThe only knowledge their government seems to suppress is anything related to the nature of The Law as a machine (which no one but the pope seems to know anyway), and anything related to their origins as Sarkaz (which I can't remember if even the pope suspected), and possibly the full details of what a Fallen Sankta is.\n\nWith freedom of information exceeded only by the Durin, with internal security and societal trust matched only by the Durin, with a lack of monetary corruption, with all the wealth they have, and with a survival-based incentive to stay ahead of the academic curve on Terra, Laterano MUST have one of the best primary and secondary education systems on Terra.\n\nAnd Terra's medical science has already determined there is little to no risk for the Infected spreading Oripathy until their corpses disintegrate.\n\nAdditionally, building and maintaining public facilities and services to accommodate for the death and impending explosions of the Infected should be extremely easy for the well-oiled bureaucratic machine of the Lateran state.\n\n\\[Guiding Ahead\\] actually showed us how efficient they are at handling the untimely death of a total social recluse. Handling the corpse of a monitored Infected should be simple in comparison, especially given the level of cooperation Lateran citizens show with their civil servants. \n\nThe moral absurdity of the exile is only slightly mitigated by the fact that the exiles remain full legal citizens, with the government checking in on them to make sure they're not being oppressed wherever they've made their home away from home. But paying to monitor and protect citizens in exile should be just as expensive as accommodating them at home; probably more so.\n\n# Laws\n\nThere are three kinds of laws in Laterano:\n\n1. \"The Law\" itself. The secret machine that enforces its own unspoken, unwritten dictates.\n2. The law chosen by the state, which the majority of the people accept without revolt.\n3. And the law that the people demand the government enforce.\n\nThe Sarkaz ban could easily be either the second or the third. The highest levels of the original state wanted to keep any Sarkaz from accidentally revealing the true origins of the Sankta, but the modern people also hate and fear the Sarkaz.\n\nBut I don't see why the Infected ban would be either.\n\n# The People\n\nThe Sankta do not fear feeling the emotions of other Sankta suffering from injury and disease; they maintain public hospitals. They have funeral homes and mourning practices.\n\nAlso, Laterans show no discomfort at all with authorized, scheduled explosions. They regularly blow up public property with Originium for fun. Controlling for the explosions of the dead Infected would be far less fun, but no less safe.\n\nThe continued existence of their civilization depends on the mining, refining, and consumption of Originium. Everything from maintaining Laterano's mobility as a nomadic city, to fueling their factories, to serving as the accelerant for their explosives and the ammunition of their precious Guardian Guns.\n\nEven with the world's best safety practices and protections for miners and gunsmiths, accidents happen. That's how Arene became Infected and exiled -- his parents either made a lapse in their safety practices or something completely unexpected happened in the course of an experiment.\n\n# The Secret\n\nWe have at least two Infected Sankta at Rhodes Island -- Adnachiel and Arene.\n\nNeither one of them show any sign of Sarkaz heritage because of their Oripathy. They haven't Fallen, they retain full halo-empathy, they could use Guardian Guns if they asked Executor to conduct the test for them, they haven't grown horns or tails...\n\nAnd on top of that, Ambriel shows absolutely no signs of discomfort in their presence. But then, she joined Rhodes Island in the first place, and no Sankta would do that if they were afraid of Oripathy.\n\n# The Law\n\nThe Pope suggests that if the Law has a goal or agenda, it is to ensure the survival of the Sankta.\n\nCould the Law be the reason that the government exiles the Infected? Perhaps it sees their proximity as too much of a threat?\n\nBut the Law apparently does nothing to punish or discourage the Sankta from accepting Liberi as fellow citizens.\n\n(I doubt the Law is actively refusing to transform Liberi into Sankta. Because if the Law truly wanted to ensure the survival of the Sankta, there would be few better ways to do that than to transform as many willing converts as possible into Sankta, or at least to allow non-Sankta to have Sankta children.)\n\nWe know that Sankta can become Infected in Laterano without an immediate response from the Law. Arene did not Fall. Though it is possible that the earliest generations of Sankta noticed that Infected Sankta who remained too close to the Law would eventually Fall.", "ups": 78, "permalink": "/r/arknights/comments/16qa3ew/i_dont_understand_lateranos_exile_policy_for_the/", "num_comments": 25}, "replies": [{"selftext": "It's likely not their own personal decision but a rule by LAW.

That the prosperity of Laterano is founded upon the fact that a similar society structure is only possible among the Sanktas. There are two main points, the limited resources and the special \"empathy\" of Sanktas. \n\nThis made Laterano different from the Durins. The Durins' civilization is heaven-like because of their advanced technology and abundance of resources. The Lateran civilization, however, have an average amount of resources compared to other countries, so they thrive under one factor: they are pure.\n\nPurity leads to less internal fractions, thus leads to much higher resource efficiency that even as a country with average technology (excluding the supercomputer) and resources, Sanktas can decide to blow up a building just for fun. So in Laterano, those extra resources were allocated to make their citizens happy, while in other countries, those resources (possibly at much higher amount) would be allocated to crowd control, put down riots, or even civil wars.\n\nAnd even the Liberis in Laterano can feel they are \"citizens to a lesser extent\", so imagine now, Laterano says, \"we would like to cancel the exile policy of the infected and see everyone as equal\", wow that's great, but what's going to happen? Infected from all across Terra is going to rush to Laterano because policies everywhere else are simply so much worse. And that will result in a huge increase in non-Sankta population, who is going to feel the same thing as the Liberis: they don't have the Sankta's \"empathy\", so they wouldn't be at those important society positions, they wouldn't be granted the same privileges, they would feel like they are being discriminated, they would be thinking about how they escaped the discrimination in other countries expected to find a safe-heaven for themselves but ended up disappointing, and there you go, society being torn into two.\n\nSo, Laterano, with its limited resources, doesn't want to be overrun by an influx of immigrants that can fundamentally alter their carefully maintained society structure. How to do that? You don't differentiate your policies with the rest of the countries. It's as simple as that. Even if Laterano doesn't need to cast out the infected Sanktas, leaving that window open is a window to be exploited. No need to look further, what about an infected Lateran Liberi? How about an infected Liberi born outside of Laterano?\n\nSociety's \"purity\" is not something we would talk about in real life, because, well, we as humans don't have that much of a difference, and \"purity\" have led to pretty nasty things in the past. \n\nBut for Sanktas, they are just objectively different from other races, and their society's foundation was built on this difference.

I also really liked his character design and role during Goldenglow's event.\n\nAnd the fact that he made his most recent appearance in the MAIN STORY is awesome to see, alongside another Pink Cat that looks to be a very good 5\\* material operator. Seeing how Neo-Reunion might be having a bigger role in Chapter 13 will be a very interesting to see, and if we ever see Neo-Reunion and Rhodes Island do some sort of temporary alliance It'll add more fuel more fire to having an actual Neo-Reunion Banner with him in it. I'm hoping to see him become a 6\\* if ever, but due to the appearance of Nine and Talulah he might be relegated to becoming a 5\\*.

Hypergryph decided for her to \"burn herself out\" in New Reunion with Nine and the folks.

{"post": {"title": "The City of Angels", "subreddit": "arknights", "selftext": "Before Iberia fell to the Great Silence, there were already Liberi living in Gaul. Before Gaul fell, there were already Liberi living in Victoria. Before Victoria began its fall, there were already Liberi living in rising Columbia.\n\nLiberi are citizens in countries all over Terra, and only in some of them are they a minority. In Iberia they are the overwhelming majority, and in Columbia they are a considerable majority. The only country we can suppose the Liberi face any significant discrimination simply for being Liberi is the Ursus Empire, where the Ursus are the racial majority and favorite.\n\nTo all appearances thus far, Liberi are more likely to face discrimination on the basis of *civic* identity. Just as Victorian felines and Taran felines see each other as Tarans and Victorians, Columbians and Iberians would see each other as Iberians and Columbians.\n\nBut the Laterano are Sankta, and the Sankta have only Laterano.\n\nBecause once upon a time, they were Sarkaz.\n\n# Covenant\n\nOne day, a tribe of Sarkaz decided that they had enough of Kazdel's endless cycle of destruction and vengeance. They left behind their homeland and people, and all the dreams and grudges of the past, to build something new and peaceful.\n\nThe remaining Sarkaz regarded them as traitors, and harassed them, but the expatriates found something that gave them a chance to survive: The Law.\n\nThe new Sankta built a city around the Law, both figuratively and literally. The city of Laterano became a fortress to protect the Sankta from the rest of the world. That also meant protecting the Law which made them Sankta.\n\nShould anyone or anything ever succeed in destroying Laterano, the Law itself might be destroyed. That might cause all Sankta to immediately Fall, and revert back to Sarkaz.\n\nPerhaps if this even deprives them of their 'wings' and dimmed halos, they might be able to pass for normal Sarkaz, and seek refugee among them... but just as their ancestors once rejected Kazdel and the Sarkaz cycle of violence, the descendants would likely reject such a fate as well. Especially since the many generations in between proved that a different and better life is possible.\n\nIt must be noted:\n\nLaterano has never been an empire. It did not conquer and annex other nations. It took no slaves, demanded no tributes. Everyone who lives in Laterano, does so by choice; few who have the choice to leave, ever do.\n\nFurthermore, everything Laterano owns, its people built with their own hands. Though without the grace of the Law, they probably could not succeed so much a second time.\n\n# Diaspora\n\nBut even if the Law survived the destruction of Laterano, the Sankta would not.\n\nFirst you have the mass depopulation from whatever destroyed their nation. Then you have most of the survivors dying from untreated injuries, illnesses without medicine, starvation, thirst, food poisoning, beast attacks, weather exposure, Catastrope, Oripathy, opportunistic and vengeful Sarkaz attacks...\n\nFurthermore, Sankta can only have Sankta children with other Sankta. So if the survivors simply disperse, they will breed themselves out of existence. Otherwise, wherever they settle, they have to form Sankta-only \"Little Lateranos\" and Sankta ghettos and keep tightly to their own kind. This will make them seem insular and unfriendly to the natives of their new homes, and thus will invite persecution and exploitation.\n\nIf anything, learning the truth that Sankta could have Sankta children with Sarkaz might do more harm than good to the possibility of the Sankta recovering from the loss of their homeland. Especially if the weakness of Cecelia's halo would only be weaker for any of her potential children with a Sarkaz. That way, too, might only breed the Sankta out of existence.\n\n# Immigration\n\nFor that matter, allowing any non-Sankta into the citizenry of Laterano poses a risk to the perpetuation of the Sankta people. And yet they do allow it.\n\nNo Liberi, regardless of devotion, can become Sankta or even give birth to Sankta. But this is not because the Sankta wish it so.\n\nThe Sankta have no power to share their blessings with others. At worst, the Sankta choose to ignore the question rather than seek the answers as Andoain did.\n\nThe Sankta do not forbid Liberi from applying to join the Apostolic Knights; they merely require that Liberi pass the same tests that Sankta do.\n\nFiammetta would have been the first Liberi in Lateran history to succeed, though she still wouldn't have been able to use the standard weaponry compatible only to Sankta. But even then, the Knighthood was willing to bend their standards for her, and it was her own choice to refuse to join them.\n\n\\[Guiding Ahead\\] gives faces and voices to a number of Lateran attitudes. Fiammetta represents Liberi who love Laterans as much or more than Laterano itself, Andoain and Patia represent those Laterans who demand answers to the taboo questions...\n\nBut at no point in \\[Guiding Ahead\\] is Sankta bigotry against other races so pronounced that the narrative introduces a bigoted character who openly views non-Sankta as contemptible or pitiable. The three most authoritative figures in the story don't even clearly hate the Sarkaz, let alone Lateran Liberi.\n\nFiammetta's third Archive File does reveal that there are at least two \"braindead colleagues\" among the Apostolic Knights (or the Notarial Hall) who would not \"shut up\" about Fiammetta's fitness to join their order. *Only* two, among the whole institution.\n\nWhereas the one writing in her defense says \"Old friend, we agree with your opinion.\" If the 'we' refers to at least two, then the 'old friend' is a third ally in Fiammetta's favor.\n\nA hard number of \"two\" in vocal opposition, versus a potential three or more advocates. Furthermore, the files don't even make explicit what the two vocal dissenters find concerning. Do they complain because they simply want to keep the Knights racially pure, or do they simply worry that Fiammetta's nonstandard weaponry would bring unnecessary complication to their order's combat capabilities?\n\nFurthermore, we see NO racial tensions in the streets.\n\nEzell talks just as easily with other Sankta citizens as he does with Liberi citizens. Liberi citizens respond to him no differently than other Sankta.\n\nOf course the differences are still there. Everyone knows the differences are there, especially the Sankta who cannot feel the presence or emotions of the Liberi. But no one wants to bring attention to those differences, or make a big deal out of them.\n\nIt's similar to how, in \\[Lingering Echoes\\], everyone in Vyseheim's Afterglow district KNEW that Hibiscus was a Sarkaz and not an Elafia or Caprinae.

They obscured their history, they changed their language...\n\nAnd they tried to ensure that no Sarkaz would ever lay with a Sankta in the holy city to have a Sankta child, and that no Sarkaz would ascend the Tower of Revelation to say, \"Hey, Siri!\" in a language that the Law would understand.\n\nWith this hypothetical true reason for the law forgotten, it seems the modern Sankta continue to uphold it out of tradition, and because of the ancestral fear and hatred of all Sarkaz inspired by Kazdel's aggressions against the sankta, continuing from the present day since before the founding of Laterano.", "ups": 80, "permalink": "/r/arknights/comments/16piz85/the_city_of_angels/", "num_comments": 27}, "replies": [{"selftext": "What caughts more my attention about the Liberi population is that, according to what Kal\u00b4tsit said in Discovered terra 3.0, they came to Laterano because of the Sankta\u00b4s delicate balance between desserts and firearms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was never becasue of the Silence, but rather...apple pies and guns.", "ups": 29, "depth": 0, "author": "JowettMcPepper", "replies": [{"selftext": "Yeah, the Liberi living in Laterano immigrated in long before the Great Silence.\n\nI said that in the first sentence.\n\nEDIT: I did NOT say that in the first sentence; I said something similar.

Her S2 is a gigantic and long duration burst heal that lets you tank through tons of shit and her talent is universally useful everywhere. (seriously not buying hipster argument that like a probably 25% or so average reduction in skill cooldown time on the majority of skills in the game isn't a big deal) \n\nThe other medics may be better in some circumstances, but that's the thing 'some circumstances', but those can be pretty narrow while Ptilopsis is pretty much going to be useful and provide value anywhere without fail. Skalter is the same way and that's why she's usually my 'off healer/buffer' that I most often pair with Ptilopsis in my 'standard' comp.  \n\n* Lumen has strong sustained single target output (once he's ramped up), but not much real burst to carry through tough sections or enemy AOE, his talent is also pretty obviously only of value when status effects are prevalent in a stage. The range isn't usually a major factor and AoE healers weird range where they can hit a hex behind them can easily have it's uses as well. \n* Warfarin's support is literally rolling a dice unless you place her such she only has one target, which has some pretty obvious problems. If the set up is such that it doesn't really matter what her buff hits... then you didn't need the buff in the first place, and any SP her talent might recover is going to pale compared to what Ptilopsis provides the entire team just by existing. Furthermore if Skalter is in the comp you've already got buffing without that irritating RNG.   \n* Nightingale's talent is again more niche really only being worth it over Ptilopsis if there's allot of arts flying around, and furthermore it only applies within range while Ptilopsis helps everyone with a per second SP skill on the map just by existing. \n* Reed is something else and doesn't really belong in the conversation for possible 'main healer' position like the others might.

They ultimately cover the same niche, but Nightingale has the arts resistance edge (and the deployable cages) over Ptilopsis who can *just* heal and thats it.\n\nAnd while 25% SP recovery sounds great at first, it comes with a caveat that is often overlooked: The extra regen only matters if you *actually* use the skills immediately when they are recharged. But many skills in the game are situational and shouldn't be activated immediately but only when actually needed. Look at it this way: If you wait 5 seconds before activating a fully charged skill, Ptilopsis SP regen was completely pointless on that operator.\n\nSo ask yourself this: Do you immediately activate most of the skills in your team once they are recharged? If your answer is yes, then Ptilopsis will absolutely be worth bringing. If your answer is no, then most likely it isn't worth it to bring her over Nightingale or other medics with support capability.\n\nAnd while Warfarins SP recovery talent might not be as widespread useful as Ptilopsis, it comes at the advantage that it benefits attack and defensive charge skills too.\n\nSo, essentially, who *really* benefits from Ptilopsis support?\n\n- Myrtle\n\n- Units with auto recovery auto activation skills or charge storing skills: Exusiai, Ifrit, Eyjafyalla, Passenger, Dorothy, etc.\n\n\nWho doesn't benefit?\n\n- Units with attack and defense recovery\n\n- Units with very situational cooldowns\n\n- Units with already short cycle times (since Ptilopsis talent is useless during SP lockout)\n\nHonestly, that's not very convincing to me. But I agree that depends on your team setup. Most of my favorite operators don't benefit a lot from her talent because either their cooldowns are too situational or their skills are attack-recovery.

K easy 2 forces, JK there's 3 lungman groups (chen+ Wei+ and the rat king +) then you have the almost 5 separate reunion groups (radicals, Faust mephisto, Patriot frost, W, and the core with Tal/k) it feels like there's too many cooks in the kitchen, and while they do actually have the various groups tripping over each other it gets out of hand quickly trying to remember why those groups are doing what they are doing or with some kf the super minor charscters whos on whos side. This I feel is even worse in the current Victoria arc, and you have the dukes, Dublinn, glasglow gang, loyalists, sarkaz, the underground, those that joined the sarkaz, RI but also W doing her own thing. \n\nIt has MASSIVE world building, but the rate of uplaod is too slow to actively keep pace.

He didn't need a reason, he did it because he viewed all others beyond his little morality pet Faust beneath him and as nothing more than cattle, hence why his soldiers were referred to as \"the herd\".

Protect the soldiers!\n\nI think this pretty much covers my line \u2013 both times Talulah prioritizes others over herself; you pretty much ignore her entire character prior to possession, prior to chapter 8, which really doesn't lead to an understanding of character and her personality or motives, and thus \u2013 you cannot really discuss her with me in good faith.\n\nHere are further examples:\n\n&gt;Or the fact how she always pretty much attempted to forgive people for wrongdoing and understand them\n\nChapter 8, R8-8\n\n&gt;Patriot: Take a count of the dead and wounded. It's just as you said. They used us as bait, and a battle ensued.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Patriot: Are you disappointed, Talulah?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Talulah: \u2014No. They had their reasons for doing this, and I also know exactly what they were. Knowing they had a legitimate reason, I couldn't possibly have gotten my hopes up.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Patriot: ...The informant must be executed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Talulah: And how should we pick out this traitor, out of all the people that wanted to flee the battlefield?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Patriot: They betrayed their brothers-in-arms for a moment of peace. If you make excuses for them, you're only putting your warriors in harm's way.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Talulah: No. They never swore their loyalty to us in the first place.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Talulah: You want every last person on your team to be absolutely perfect? That's impossible. You won't find a squad like that anywhere.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Shieldguard: But the guerrillas\u2014  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Talulah: The guerrilla fighters aren't perfect either. There are only a handful of people as perfect as you're making them out to be. Everyone else has their own reasons to be here, and only because they are willing to pay the price, but that doesn't mean they've thought it all through.\n\nIs that not willingness to accept and forgive everyone? And Talulah is getting constantly punished for that by story, and by players. Talulah is not ideal, this bit contains a flaw of hers, and it is hardly pride if you bother to explore her character a bit more.\n\n&gt;Pre-Kaschey? Sure, nobody would deny that. During-Kaschey? How did she sacrifice herself? Did all those death a happy ending?\n\nYou are conflating two things: results and intentions.

As I was trying to add new flairs for characters that u/peripheralmaverick requested, we have reached the subreddit flair limit of 350. That means that right now, we won't be able to add any new flairs, be it for existing NPCs or future operators. There are some solutions to this problem that we came up with:\n\n* Delete flairs for faction logos. There are currently about 15 flairs which are just faction logos, not characters. I think these are barely used and should be removed in favor of characters. However, this is obviously just a short term solution, so we also need to decide on something else when the issue inevitably arises again in a few months.\n* Strictly limit flairs to playable operators, exclude NPCs. This might seem to be the next logical step when the slots run out again. We understand that this would be controversial and unpopular with many people. There are undoubtedly some NPCs which are more commonly used as flairs than some operators. But it would still at least be a standardized approach.\n* Don't add any new flairs. Simply keep everything as it is. No flairs are being lost, but future operators and NPCs also won't receive any.\n\nThese are the solutions we thought about so far, so we're interested to hear your thoughts about this. Unfortunately we have no option to see how often a specific flair is being used, so we can't simply go by objective popularity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: So we may have found a away to circumvent this issue altogether. While there is a limit on premade *flairs*, there is none for *emojis*. Every flair of ours is based on an emoji, but you can still simply include the name of the emoji between colons (e.g. :amiya:) in your flair text and it will show the corresponding emoji. It works just like a flair, the only difference being that it uses up the character limit for flairs. This means that regardless of the flair limit, you can still have an emoji for every new operator and NPC, you'll just have to type it in manually.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "GrafVergeltung", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Happy 200k!\n\nHere's to another two hundred thousand people being dumb enough to join us.\n\nAs for feedback, well, you guys do a good job keeping this sub relatively decent.

Wei was being closely monitored by the Imperial Censors (including Leizi), to ensure that he was doing everything he could to defend Lungmen from the Reunion invasion. And as far as the Censors were concerned, the Infected population in the slums were a threat, not only because of possible sympathisers, but also because scattered Reunion units were hiding among them.\n\nWei was forced to take action, and had no choice but to order the slaughter to secure the area. However, the Rat King was never going to allow this to happen, not just because he's a friend who knows better, but also because as the underworld's kingpin, it would be a major blow to his authority to allow such an atrocity to happen to people who are ostensibly under his \"protection\".\n\nThat's why the Rat King intervened to prevent the purge. By the same token, it would make absolutely zero sense for Lin to carry out the massacre against her father's wishes; she's clearly intelligent enough to know what's at stake and we would eventually learn that, in terms of personality and aspirations, Lin is actually more aligned with Swire and Ch'en than she lets on.\n\nSo what actually did happen? Some people did die; bodies were found. Firstly, in order for the Rat King's ruse to work, he had to rescue as many of the Infected as he could, while also leaving something behind to convince the Censors that the purge was carried out as ordered. So, it has long been my assumption that the bodies were planted. Who were the dead, though? That's never been explained, but I like the conjecture that at least some may have been killed by Shadow Guards who followed Wei's orders.\n\nWhat we knew for certain by the end of Ep8 is that Lin Kojui definitely intervened and at least some of the Shadow Guard disobeyed orders. What we also come of know about Lin Yuhsia is that she's very much devoted to her father (even if she'd never openly say it), so it's also inconceivable that she'd knowingly sabotage her father's plan. She's also not headstrong or rash like Ch'en, so in that regard, it's also inconceivable that she would have killed Infected in anger.\n\nSo where does that leave us? Most likely some Infected were killed during the chaos of the invasion. The fog of war is such that it's probably impossible to fully ascertain what exactly happened.

Some of these are QOL, some are for tryharding, but most of these could probably help people along. I've beaten both endings 1 and 2 so far, so here's some of the best tips I've got.\n\nPutting two LV2 monitor towers in a map lets you see all tiles within 2 moves of the area. Which means that you could speedrun the center of a sector, drop 2 monitor towers down in the level itself, and instantly reveal the majority of the sector. Useful if you wanna pick off key areas fast.\n\nVein Guardians, for whatever reason, can't reflect any damage to an operator on a \"Firm Platform\" (the construct that turns a tile ranged, and can be placed anywhere.) If you want to face them instead of resetting the run, you can try placing a ranged DPS on those platforms you brought yourself, and try to chip them down. No guarantees, though, since Melee units have no such protection.\n\nThe Mudrock Collosi wave has 10 enemies. If you have over 10 life points (which can be accomplished through constructs at home base), you can enter the stage with nobody and leak all the collosi. You didn't die, so the game counts that as a victory and deletes them off the map. (If the Collosi combine with another wave or you don't have over 10 LP, this probably won't work.)\n\nWhen out of Fungi, 3 Puffball Tenderloins can craft a -8 DP cost food.

Adding Vein guardians to it is just brutal.", "ups": 3, "depth": 2, "author": "RandomdudeNo123", "replies": []}]}]}, {"selftext": "A few things beforehand: this game mode is mainly aimed at those who have a decent squad of e2's built. Theoretically I can see ways for someone with only e1's to kill the boss by building those Tesla coils, however then you have to build your base in a certain way using the gas tanks to push the exploding spiders away from the Tesla coils, meaning you would have to avoid ending 2 all together, because the boss will further spawn spiders right where he stands.\n\nIn the beginning you want to rush building those farms, allowing you having more food at the start of each round. Somewhere in the middle there will be more shop options, including buying more food and water, reducing the need to hunt at the start of each round. Next building you should prioritize are the building that allows you to carry items into the next round (unlockable in the tech tree, including how many items you can take with you), a mint that converts excess iron into crude gold (I'm currently at a stage where I earn more crude gold than spend buying).\n\nYou can place a farming bot on 4 of its corresponding resource at the start of the run and it will harvest everything over the run. If there are more than 4 resource or you placed your bot halfway through the run you want to add aoe DMG to harvest it faster for you.\n\nUnits like silverash, mlynar, if there are ranged tiles eyja, ling/carnelian, Chen alter will work.\n\nIf you are at the beginning, harvesting the resource will be a pain unless you have fast redeploys + pseudo fast redeploys with more than 1 block (like yato and Mr. Nothing on skill 1). You can also always feed them a dish made from 3 crab legs to get more block, therefore faster harvesting.\n\nFor raids:\n\nOf course you can always intercept them outside to reduce the number of enemies, here is what I assume for those who have a built base.\n\nFor the base itself you want to have one kill zone with only a small gap for entrance and a small gap leading to the center tower. You don't want to build really directly around the kill area, since aoe dmg can destroy the walls (especially those exploding spiders). To counter against enemies smashing through your walls you have to do following things:\n\nBuild only using the tier 2 walls, they have camouflage. Otherwise there are few units that will target those buildings specifically. They are invisible unless the enemy clips into them (by pathing or bring pushed into the walls).\nPlace your buildings at minimum two tiles from the enemy pathing. Those crocodiles with ranged attack will otherwise stop and attack them instead.\nTo counter the catapults (who have larger range) I personally build several of those bulky tier 2 road blockers, they will stop and attack them while you deal with the rest of the raid. Once everyone else is more or less dealer with then I deploy fast redeploys or surtr to deal with them.\n\nIf there is an raid with a boss in it, you want to feed your tankiest defender food to further buff its defense and HP. I used curora e2lv40 + 50% HP and defense and she can stall anyone as long as she has a separate medic for herself even without her skill active. Keep the boss in place while you kill everything around them.\n\nIf you don't have a defender capable to stall the boss with food buff, you can instead deploy road blockers instead. The tier 2 have enough HP and defense to hold a single boss long enough in place for you to deploy the next road block with the 30 sec deployment time. Note that this is under the assumption that you kill everything else\n\nIn base you want anyone with aoe DMG because of the sheer number of enemies the raid throws at you. \nAnyone with high enough dmg to deal with troublesome waves like Chen alter, mlynar are helpful, then for the general enemies others like Ifrit, horn s1, reed alter with s3, fiametta s3 (more on her later).\n\nFurthermore you want to stall the enemies long enough that you can kill them without blocking, your defender ain't going to block 50 enemies coming at once. Your can deploy rows of net throwers to keep them in place and gas tanks to push them back.\n\nAs for units there are Mostima, suzuran s3 for the further fragile, saria s3, but also ambushers like mizuki, manticore (especially with her own permanent item giving her +100 attack speed) and Ethan are a godsent. Unless there are spiders in the mix, then you better place a healer or two. Or don't use any ambushers. Or silence the spiders. Or kill them before they reach your ambushers (especially during the first few raids with spiders + dog rushes I just place 8 snipers to kill them all with stalling with the net throwers).\n\nOf course, there is surtr. For those vein guardians who reflect dmg I just deploy her and her medic army to keep her alive. If you need to further stall them you can place road blockers Infront of surtr. In my case I used skadi alter as main healer, ptilopsis and mulberry as burst healer, saria s1 + 3 more medics to keep her alive.\n\nI feed mainly attack buffs to the dmg squad, but also to the healers. Fast redeploys get the reduced dp cost since it matters for them the most. \n\nYou can't carry most of the food with you into the next run, use them. You can't take most of the materials with you, so use them. Sp batteries, redeployment orders, mines, road blockers, use them all.\n\nAlso, just to note, currently the ranged tiles are bugged that the units on then won't take damage or get healed. Which means the mentioned fiametta won't get healed unless you place her on one of the existing ranged tiles at the sides of warfarin should never target someone with her s2 for the buff, since she can't heal the unit and both will die from hp loss.\n\nThe only thing I carry to the next runs (since I know how to deal with everything) are remaining food buffs using the legendary meat (30% - 50% attack ups, -18 dp cost, reduced redeployment times + 40% extra HP works wonders on surtr, reduced redeployment + reduced skill cd is amazing on skadi s3, the before mentioned +50% hp and defense on curora) + 4 tier 2 recon beacons, allowing me to search for important nodes really fast at the start of the run.", "ups": 8, "depth": 0, "author": "arararagi_vamp", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "A tip for players without a lot of meta units: use the support items.

{"post": {"title": "Reclamation Algorithm: Fire Within the Sands Design Discussion", "subreddit": "arknights", "selftext": "Like with [my prior thread on IS#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/arknights/comments/lx9nof/integrated_strategies_ceobes_fungimist_design/), I hotly anticipated Reclamation Algorithm as probably the most unique mode and ambitious mode we've received since IS. I see a lot of parallels between RA#1 and IS#1 in terms of big ambitious modes that majorly recontextualize the game's mechanics, with implementation that can lead to a lackluster and frustrating experience, but that nevertheless shows potential I'd love to see explored more in a follow-up event. After having now completed everything the mode has to offer, I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss Reclamation Algorithm.\n\n# The Good\n\n**Survival and Base-Building are Fun**\n\nThese are mechanics and situations not normally seen in Arknights. I'm a huge proponent of any mode that offers fun new experiences that can allow specific units to shine and generally add variety to the game (why I love IS so much). I'm a very progression-minded player, so I love the idea of slowly accumulating resources to build up a massive megabase over the course of many hours in a mode. IS features some cross-run progress (upgrade tree, relic unlocks, ingot investment) but IS's roguelike nature necessitates that most of your power gets reset every run. Reclamation Algorithm resets some stuff, but the most important progression, your base, persists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unique Approach to Arknights Story**\n\nI really enjoyed this new twist on Arknights narrative, building character interactions and stories directly into stages. I loved how the black market completely ignored the normal qualities of an Arknights stage and just uses it for character interactions (even if it does get a bit tedious later).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lots of Quality Content**\n\nThey made a *lot* of solid content for this mode. All the new exploration maps, all of the text for all of the events and story, the entire food system, and so forth. I recognize a lot of development resources were invested into making this mode, and the raw stuff of it is quite good. This reminds me, again, of IS#1 with all the time spent on that mode's maps and relics. I want to see that investment pay off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Room for Improvement\n\n**Tutorial Fails to Explain the Game Mode**\n\nStarting off easy, one of the most common complaints about this mode is that the tutorial does little to actually prepare the player for the mode. Because the mode plays so differently from base Arknights, it requires more to learn it. It seems like the current tutorial mostly just confuses players. The complexity of the mode is such that the best way to learn will be through play, but the tutorial could at least have done a better job of introducing the basics the player needs to know and pointing them in the right direction of how to make progress (speed run 12 patty fields, then work on building your base and tech tree, then work on tackling story if you want).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Resource Collection Slow and Tedious**\n\nAs this is a survival game, a good chunk of time is spent collecting resources. Unfortunately, this just isn't fun. Pick your poison: Repeatedly placing Fast Redeploys over and over again for three minutes straight, trying your best to minimax their timers as they slap rocks? Repeatedly placing FRDs chasing livestock around a stage? Placing a couple of Gathering Hubs down and then just watching them work for three minutes? Oh what's that, you just need some water, so you're going to enter a stage and just stare at this one Crabbie Pump for three minutes to maximize its value? All of these just take **time,** and not in a fun way. There's a lot of waiting, a lot of tedium, a lot of sitting around waiting for number to go up, while nothing particularly interesting happens. Some gathering maps have new enemies waltz in partway through, but they rarely do anything to actually disrupt your operations, especially after you've learned the maps. The result is that players are encouraged to find any way they can to bypass this tedium and avoid spending time gathering resources in maps (something I'll revisit in a bit).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UI/QoL Missed Opportunities**\n\nAlong these lines of how the player interacts with the mode and learns what's going on, there's lots of little opportunities to reduce frustration and improve clarity. A basic example of reducing friction would be allowing players to feed operators isotonic when selecting which operators to send on a dispatch. It's frustrating to go for a dispatch that wants 4 ops, then realize that you only have 3 ops prepped that you want to send, having to back out multiple screens to go feed a fourth, then having to go back in to the dispatch screen. An example of a game mechanic that currently relies on very subtle UI to communicate is the entire sentry/outpost mechanic, which the player can technically learn about by tapping on a faint icon in the top right when inspecting a node.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stale Unit Meta**\n\nAs mentioned in the Goods, I love any mode that can give new uses to old operators. I love how Integrated Strategies gives renewed value to low-rarity operators (though 5-stars still suffer), so I was excited to see the possibilities for what units Reclamation Algorithm would encourage. Well, RA's mechanics reward a handful of things: The fog-of-war mechanic rewards \"Squares of vision per second\" for searching a map, the resource-collection mechanic rewards \"block per second\" for picking up resources, the hunting maps rewards damage and vision quickly moving around the map, raids reward true AoE, No Man's Land/Mountain Pass/Raid Bosses all reward heavy burst damage. Vision per second, block per second, and mobile damage are all supplied by Fast Redeploys (Tex2, Ya2, Phantom). Burst damage is mostly supplied by your traditional meta burst ops (Surtr, Mlynar, NTRK, Tex2, Kaltsit, Eyja, etc.).\n\nOnce you get to the point where you're mostly using gathering hubs so you don't need to pick up resources yourself, Mlynar/Surtr/Eyja/SA all become useful for quickly leveling trees/rocks/ore as well. Out of this list, only Phantom is not considered a top-tier meta op already. I thought it was neat that Mr. Nothing could use his Block 2 FRD status to pick stuff up, but this becomes pointless once you're using gathering hubs, and his DPS is low enough before that for it to be tedious. So really the only part of the mode that really gives opportunities for non-meta units to shine is the raids- Where else except Mostima's Paradox Simulation do you get enemies that tightly clumped for AoE casters to actually justify their existence?\n\nIn addition to just being a missed opportunity to celebrate more units, this meta poses an issue for newer players wanting to engage in this time-limited mode. With no way to bring support units from friends, RA in a lot of ways is a blunt check on how many E2 meta operators the player has, with experiences varying wildly as a result. This might be one thing if RA was framed as a challenge mode like CC (where newer players can participate a little for a good chunk of rewards, but it's clear that the mode is built for endgame players), but that's not the case, and I think RA is better off as a mode built for a range of player development anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Poor Stamina Balance**\n\nStamina is a fine idea, but in practice feels like a chore. At the start of the mode, stamina is an oppressive mechanic preventing the player from bringing more than a couple units to each stage, necessitating that early time is spent gathering food to convert into Isotonic instead of spending that time actually progressing in the mode. This is part of what makes the start of the mode feel so unfriendly to a lot of players. But then the first thing you do is build 12 patty fields, at which point stamina is never an issue ever again. Except wait it is, because you still need to actually remember to give it to your operators. You still need to convert your rice into isotonic every day. Once you have your patty fields, the stamina mechanic is 90% just a busywork you need to do. The only real thing it does to impact your gameplay is put a cap on how much you can use a single unit, since you can only feed them once a day but can take two actions. But at 3 starting stamina, you could use one unit 7 times over 4 days and only then need to care, and that's assuming you're not spending any Actions to Dispatch or do encounters, and not making any use of stamina-regenerating foods. This in turn further punishes newer players with lower-level rosters who can't start with a squad of 6 meta units all at 3 stamina and thus are more quickly pushed to use other operators that they may not have raised.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Basebuilding Woes**\n\nBasebuilding is my favorite part of Reclamation Algorithm, and it's also probably the the feature I'm most disappointed with. Sure, everyone agrees you should be able to move stuff around (or at least deconstruct for a refund or partial refund) and I fully support this. But beyond that, I see lots of missed opportunities.\n\n* Lack of ability to move structures: This created so much decision paralysis for me that I struggled to start the mode, because I was worried my time spent was going to be wasted if I needed to destroy stuff to build \"properly\" later. This just makes the mode unfriendly for players and discourages experimentation or incremental growth. Since you can't move things, players are encouraged to map their base from the very start and build their endgame base immediately, skipping over any intermediary exploration they may have had.\n* Noncombat structures: Why do I, as a player, need to place patty fields instead of them being a permanent upgrade/unlock somewhere? Enemies almost completely ignore non-combat structures, so you can safely stash them in a corner or cover them in Barriers and they'll never be touched. You don't need to build around them and accommodate them, they just create decision paralysis due to the inability to relocate things and being a pain to rebuild. There *is* a convenient area at the bottom of the base where the player can freely stash some non-combat structures out of the way without needing worry about them getting in the way of their fortress, but confusingly most of the tiles in that area are non-placeable. Either this area should be expanded so non-combat structures can be fully moved out of the combat area, or the developers should embrace the notion of your non-combat structures being exposed to risk and needing to be protected within your base.\n* One viable strategy: A side effect of how base-building works and how raids work, there is essentially only one strategy, which is to surround your base in Barrier II's so there's only one route in to funnel the entire wave into an orderly single-file line, then set up a killbox with all of your true AOE sustained damage, ideally with the walls a space away to give room for spider explosions. The exact shape differs, and some players choose to add mazes to delay enemies, but a simple killbox with no frills was plenty for me to clear all three endings. This is disappointing, as I'd love to see multiple clever and creative setups in what is the closest we've gotten to an Arknights level-editor.\n* Cost of destruction: Given how long it takes to build a base, it can be extremely demoralizing to lose it. Because of the reading I did before starting the mode, I essentially avoided raids until my base was ready, but I heard about players encountering spiders or catapults unprepared and losing huge chunks of their base made of Barrier I's. It seems like like raids typically result in either absolutely no damage, very minor damage, or massive damage. Experienced players with built bases will essentially always be in the first two categories, which means that the need to spend the time and resources to rebuild and repair just punishes new players trying to find their footing in the mode. I'd love to see an approach like in the tower defense game Thronefall where destruction happens every wave, but all structures respawn the following day (with noncombat structures essentially pausing their functionality on a night they were destroyed). This could allow for a setup in which it's acceptable from a design point of view for bases to regularly take damage, and thus reduce the need for the dominance of the killbox strategy. I'd love to actually need to manage a left flank and right flank, possibly with fall-back positions when outer defenses are breached, as opposed to stationing my units in the killbox then staring at them for multiple minutes while they mow down the hordes.\n* Lack of combat structure variety: Part of this lack of variety I believe stems from the lack of interesting combat structures to place. You've got barriers (enemies path around), platforms (enemies path around and you can place ranged units), fortifications (enemies path through but get blocked), and then the Gas Jets and Net Launchers. Both of these last two are neat but ultimately serve to slightly delay enemies, which is unnecessary when using a properly set up killbox with true AoE. There are some more devices (\"props\") you can place, and I was very excited by the notion of making a corridor of Support Coils, only to discover these as Props are temporary. Sure you \\*can\\* do this, but it's a pain and temporary. Where are my flame throwers? Placeable stage hazards to push enemies into? Turrets and artillery? Tesla gun that works like a chain caster? Towers that provide an AoE buff like Skalter? Tower that reveals invisible enemies? Something that silences spiders? Lean into the tower defense/siege defense genre here and give players more toys to play with, even if these require a lot of resources and tech unlocks to reach. These would both allow for more interesting and diverse setups, and also reduce how stat-check-heavy the mode is for new players, since they could work their way up to a flamethrower turret even if they don't own an E2 Ifrit. Obviously enemies would need to be able to fight back against these emplacements, which is where the destruction-respawn mechanic described previously is important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Story Frustrations**\n\nI mentioned at the top that I enjoyed the uniqueness of this story format. It unfortunately comes at the cost of some Dark Souls questline BS where in order to proceed a questline you need to talk to the right person at the right time, and in later endings doing the *wrong* conversation can break your questline and require you to backtrack to try again. On one hand, I found it tedious doing the later endings to pop my head into combat stages just to check for story triggers, only to then have to back out if I didn't get it. But that's got nothing over simply accessing Ending 3, which I would have found impossible without a guide. The fact that accessing Ending 3 requires *throwing away* key items earned from Ending 2, including your reward for clearing that ending, feels fundamentally wrong. You just achieved this feat and earned this great permanent-seeming reward, but then need to throw it away in order to proceed, with no indication in-game that there is another ending waiting for you if you do so. I kind of get what they were going for here, with this item-based story system where throwing away items resets those portions of the story, but as with everything else in this mode, it was poorly explained. Attaching these items to the mechanic rewards for story completion just makes this sting as you need to throw away those rewards, in which case, why even both attaching mechanic rewards to them in the first place? Just baffling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Big One: A Game in Two Parts**\n\nBy far my biggest issue with this mode is how the reset system was implemented and how it affects the two pillars of this mode: Progression/basebuilding and Raids/story. At any time a player can exit a run and keep 100% of their basebuilding progress, as well as cash in whatever points they got for the research tree. Losing a run via a raid at your base is treated exactly the same as you voluntarily exiting (assuming no other part of your base was damaged). This by itself already means that a player can farm as much as they please and refuse to interact with raids until they're ready, with the only price to be paid being the time it takes to start a new run and re-discover zones (as well as the lost resources you couldn't convert). This is then compounded by the aforementioned base destruction issue and inability to move structures in your base, which punish players for fighting raids before they're maxed out and punish players for placing any structure in a non-final position, in turn encouraging players to repeat the early part of a run repeatedly until they've maxed the progression.\n\nThis would be one thing if it was balanced against \"Well you collect more resources later in a run, so you progress slower like this.\" While this is true to an extent (some of those later ore nodes can net you 20+ iron in a few minutes), the fact that the player can unlock techs that cause them to start with resources is a HUGE problem. Starting with 6 iron every run means that the player can reset-loop to get free mats while bypassing the need to ever enter a combat stage to collect resources, which as mentioned at the top is a huge source of tedium. Well you still need water to make Barrier 2's, except once you've completed the Liaison's storyline he'll freely sell you water. This also means with a Mint you can do a reset-loop to farm gold- 15 gold gets you 5 water, which you can convert into 75 gold by converting 5 of your 6 starting iron, then resetting. Gold can buy you wood, stone, and any of the regular hunting foods. With how tedious regular resource collection is, this reset-loop poses the tempting offer of just... not playing the game, but still getting to max out everything. And this doesn't even require Transregional Communications! This seems like such an obvious blunder, allowing the player to start runs with resources that can be made permanent without having to perform any gameplay. These techs that give starting resources could have worked like how the Water techs work, just improving the quality the resource gathering hubs, providing extra output, or doing things like giving your units bonus damage vs trees/rocks/iron and making them better at collecting resources themselves, to both encourage players to still actually play the mode, and to make resource collection less frustrating and tedious at the same time.\n\nThe result of this strategy of just resetting until your progression is maxed is that the player can put off engaging with raids and completing endings until they've completed finished and there's nothing else to gain, with players even being encouraged to do this via the strict basebuilding mechanics and the lenient reset mechanics. This then puts the player in the position of just... spamming through days, waiting for the raid to show up, because they've already got everything they need. It feels bizarre to skip through 12 days doing nothing because your base is just ready now and can take anything thrown at it, and there's nothing more to be gained by collecting resources. As mentioned in the story section, the player at this point likely still has encounters they need, which means tediously checking nodes waiting for story triggers, while not actually doing anything in these stages, which in turn means that a huge chunk of your game time becomes just watching loading screens as you enter and exit stages.\n\nWhile I know this isn't every player's experiences, I know that I'm not the only one who had this sort of experience navigating the mode's systems, and I am of the opinion that the systems present encourage this sort of un-interactive play.\n\nWhat is even the point of having the 12-day clock as it's currently implemented? It makes it seem like time to prepare is supposed to be limited and precious, but the ability to reset as much as you please, repeating the first 6ish days infinitely until you've maxed the progression, means there is no such time pressure. Then when you *are* ready to fight bosses and endings, those 12 days just force you to wait and mash through days like you were waiting for your crops in Stardew Valley. There's a number of ways this issue could be addressed- A radical option would be to remove the 12-day clock entirely, remove the notion of run-resets, remove the notion of losing a run (losing a raid just delays progress, as discussed in the destruction section), meaning players can't avoid raids via resets. A probably superior option is to directly tie raids into progress, where completing raids is integral to some component of progression so you couldn't max things while ignoring raids. If doing that though, you'd need the mechanics to make dealing with early raids less punishing (your destroyed structures respawn, you can freely rearrange and repair your base, etc.). In either case, the point is to more directly attach the progression portion of the mode to the actual challenging portion of the mode, the raids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nReclamation Algorithm has a lot going for it, and I think it could be a great addition to Arknights' long-term mode selection (either as a permanent mode, which would be my preference, or as a seasonal mode), but it *needs* substantial changes in order to be an enjoyable experience throughout. I do earnestly hope that Hypergryph continues to invest in this mode and it gets an IS#2-style glow-up in the future. If you've made it to the end of this huge wall of text, congratulations!

Compared to the traditional perfectionist AK mindset, the Global Map encourages a more forgiving mindset towards the game as a whole. You aren't expected to handle everything, and instead calculate what advantages you actually WANT over just blindly grabbing everything or just winging it.\n\nDo you take exploration over guaranteed resources? Do you choose to weaken a raid early, or just face it at full force and attack a Boss instead? Do you preemptively wipe out an enemy base and prevent them from ever reaching you? YOU are a strategist, and so you'll need to strategize your long term AND short term goals. Remember, you only have 24 acts...\n\nIt's not without flaws, though. There's a very obvious heirarchy to tiles. Raids can mostly be taken at bases, so it's usually more efficient to ignore them straight up. And Broken compass, OMFG, Broken Compass... That item basically means you'll never miss out on an advantage ever again, since you'll getting an additional move every turn. And the entire point of the Global Map should feel like you're missing out- That you've chosen this path and lost out on some other lesser benefit. Broken Compass straight up invalidates that, Tile Hierarchies invalidate that, a lot of it goes to waste when you know what you're doing...\n\nOverall, more than the base building, the Global Map and it's implications are the part of RA I love the most.

I feel like some of them should actually be permanent constructs instead (e.g. coils, concealment field) with appropriate increase in their crafting cost. While camouflaged-wall labyrinth leading into a killbox would probably still be the dominant base design, having permanent coils and the like available might spice things up a little.\n\nAlso, let us dig holes to push enemies into (enemies of course will try to pass around those normally). Then the pusher towers will have a much greater value.\n\n-----------\n\nEDIT: also, the home area should be more varied than just a big rectangular piece of land with nothing in it.

You can *try* to weaken that raid out across multiple engagements before it gets to your base, but most often, I just see the Bullies completely saturate my lone Defender I get out in time, letting everything else waltz on through to let 3 leaks end the attempt. Especially as Ursus Lancers can't be caught by panic dropping ops, since they require at least Block 2 to catch *them*. After burning four stamina across two days to much the same result with my base not ready to handle them, I just built as much as I could and restarted the run. Having not built a fully enclosed base yet, the Bully Raid is still a run ender for me if that's what the RNG decides to throw at me.

And there are moderate problems in parts like the pacing and overall pacing of the game. And there are big problems with gaming comfort.\n\nThe problems are mainly related to the comfort of the game and extend to other aspects. but let's start with the rhythm. Rhythm or \u201cWhat do you know about madness? Or Groundhog Day.\" Once you've learned the maps and enemies, each individual session repeats the previous one with 95% accuracy. Boring and a lot of sanding by hand. And while you are building a base, this is your personal Purgatory.\n\nOverall Pace Since the fun only starts once you've built the base, it turns into a very long process of repeating 2/10-13 or 24 steps. and the base requires a lot and I mean a lot of resources. Oh, you just want to fight the boss and see how good your defense is. Good luck repeating all 13 days until he arrives at your base.\n\nNow a little about comfort (and a little about balance). Fog of War was a good idea the first 50 times I played the map. But it turned into a circus when there were ranged enemies beyond the operators' range. And again, I already know at what point the enemy will appear, but I have to guess again and again where they have placed the resources. Or what game wants me to play with different operators but does not allow me to create a second squad so that I can simply switch for the second action of the day, or the inability to feed operators at the time of choice. Or that entire classes have become useless unless they have a high DPS (how is Hoshi doing). The meta of this mode is even more ruthless than the IS.\n\nAnd, oddly enough, the mode can be made better by increasing the comfort of grinding and optimizing the technology tree. By making it not flat, but multi-level with the ability to improve the technology to level 5-6. But maintaining a balance, high investments, high rewards. Courier drone technology: level 1 takes 1-2 resources from the operator every 40 seconds; level 5 or 6 takes 1-6 resources every 20 seconds. technology for backpack capacity, mining speed.

This also might put the doctor in more danger if their relationship gets exposed (see: his parents getting assassinated). Lastly, silverash fully expects that their paths will diverge and they will one day be fighting against each other. With this in mind, even if silverash does see the doctor as a potential romantic partner, he wouldn't allow this to develop until he can feel safe leaving Kjerag standing on its own feet, so he can be with doctor just as himself and none of the burden that comes with him being a Silverash.", "ups": 4, "depth": 0, "author": "plagiarisingthoughts", "replies": [{"selftext": "It\u2019s okay I love angst", "ups": 3, "depth": 1, "author": "Jajamaisvu", "replies": [{"selftext": "Silversad moment", "ups": 1, "depth": 2, "author": "YearOver7816", "replies": []}]}]}, {"selftext": "The ex wife maybe", "ups": -2, "depth": 0, "author": "horntuga", "replies": [{"selftext": "Would she though?

Destroyed buildings are permanent unless you force close the game. You can retreat and try the mode again as many times as you want, you'll still get some points for the reward track and points for the Road of Prosperity. You'll lose building materials, but you should definitely prioritize upgrading the perk tree to give you starting Wood, Stone, and Iron as soon as possible, that way you can snowball into better and better runs.\n\nThe main way to gather resources is with the Gathering Hub constructs. There's one per type of resource, as well as the water pump. Once you upgrade those perks you won't need to farm trees with your operators anymore.\n\nConflict Zones are worthless, there's not much reason to do them, all they do is get in the way.\n\nThe best operators in this mode are those that can do their job globally -- Summoners, Trapmasters, Executors, Merchants, Ambriel and Goldenglow, to name a few. Perfumer and Angelina's global HP regen eliminates Acid Rain problems, especially. Jaye is seriously top tier, alongside Dorothy and Magallan, and of course, the two overpowered limited Executors. My own starting team is Dorothy, Magallan, Jaye, Lee, Kafka, and Perfumer.\n\nFood is mainly for making recipes to give buffs to operators for the rest of your run. Generally, you should get by on rice to restore operator stamina. First priority is to get 12 Planting Troughs in your base so that you get 12 rice daily. There's a perk that gives you a chance to get double rice per day, too.\n\n[This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XwLie_3aEvlGXwe9Y-sPe5TSTBHVRdgYLBjSSAGpKMk/edit#gid=0) has all of the node maps. Given the annoyance of not being able to see map layouts, I don't feel bad about this type of cheating. There's a few that don't even have ranged tiles!\n\nThere's further things to figure out, but I just wanted to cover the basics to help you get going.\n\nOverall, just be patient.

Use them to get the materials for a portable planting trough.  Focus your ops on defending the pumps/stations more than on harvesting themselves.  Each trough costs 16 wood and 4 water.\n\nYou want 12 troughs total (the maximum) - you start with 3 or so, you can place the initial few in the island south of the big map and the last 5 near your base hub.  Reset the game before you get raided if you don't think you can hold out.  \n\nInvest research into the starting wood, starting stone, starting iron, starting gatorade, and the transregional communication station.\n\n**Getting Underway:** Now that you're getting 12 wheat a day, you can convert that into gatorade and keeping ops sustained is easier.  You can refill one stamina per op per day, and can generally sustain a core team of 12 and a team of 6, or multiple teams of 8.  I recommend always using as much gatorade as you can, converting wheat and finding ops to give it to - ops not in your core team can be sent on dispatches.\n\nIron is your next goal.  Your best bet is to explore aggressively.  If you can reliably get to day 9 and clear bosses, you can do a loop where you set up tier 2 monitoring towers to convert a map node into a sentry zone, which reveals zones within 2 spaces of them, and impacts enemy movement speed in that zone.  You can use this to get a lot of map presence very quickly, finding the key zones.  Get to day 9, make and bring enough sentry towers with, repeat.  This is how you build 10+ walls/day.\n\nZones to look out for include the mountain pass and no man's land zones.  The former have pillars that, if knocked down, give a ton of resources (but also have annoying bosses).  The latter give top tier cooking materials, which vastly improve your chances in hard fights (camouflage and +50% attack / -18 deploy cost).\n\nIf you can't do those hard fights, you can do a tighter loop of grinding until you have the 6 starting iron, 15 starting stone, etc.  Then you just need a bit of water and you can build 3 tier II barriers.  Once you have the beginnings of a maze at your base that can funnel enemies, you may be able to withstand enough waves to get to day 9 and carry stuff forward.\n\nOnce you have a basic base, means of getting materials, and some recipes, the game opens up quite a bit.", "ups": 4, "depth": 1, "author": "NoseBracelet", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "I finally raised angrybird since her event is out and my oh my is she angry. the afk mechanic of \"just leave her alone to ground zero a tile in perpetuity\" is absolutely delightful", "ups": 5, "depth": 0, "author": "sentifuential", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "It finally happened.

Both on larger scale (e.g. clear this larger wave, deal with this dangerous elite), and on smaller scale (e.g. place raged DPS operator to kill these enemies in time, but I need to place ground operator to draw aggro away before that enemy comes).\n* Second, analyze the failure. It requires the previous step, because otherwise you won't be able to say why you failed. Once you know why your strategy fails you can adjust it.\n* Third, read fandom wiki for enemy description. In-game one sucks.\n* Fourth, if nothing helps, or you think there were better solutions for the stage than yours, then watch guides and clears by other doctors. If you've completed the previous steps you'll see those guides in different light, and you'll be able to learn from them instead of just copying. Try to add various tricks you see there (e.g. splitboxing, stalling to prevent spawns) to your arsenal.\n\nI strongly advise against repeating the stage you've failed without having some changes to your strategy in mind. It can be fine to do if you are not sure what went wrong and want to see it again, or when you are fine-tuning execution and timings, but not otherwise.\n\nCC12 is coming soon. I find daily stages to be very good training ground. You aren't bound by sanity or drill plans. You can tweak things about the stage and see how it affects your strategy. And yes, I mean going beyond risk 8 here.\n\n&gt; (okay maybe it is, I've had anger issues for a while now, throat tends to get hoarse from yelling after particularly rough levels)\n\nWhen this happens, it is time to say \"fuck this bullshit\", close the app, and come back few hours later with cool head and fresh ideas. I've lost count of how many times I've missed obvious solutions just because I got tilted. Angry brain doesn't work.\n\n&gt; I dunno, might just me being insecure on the internet, but I see all these impressive clears, off the wall strategies, niche playstyles, awesome achievements, and just feel... really inadequate.\n\nClears on YT usually don't contain hours of trial and error that led to them, and thus they give this incorrect impression of veni vidi vici. It doesn't work like this. Impressive clears take time and effort to make. And even if some particular one didn't it only means that the doctor who made it spent those hours earlier on clearing different stages. Now I usually can clear daily CC stage at max risk in 30~40 minutes (barring some very nasty ones), but when I was just starting max risks spending 2~4 hours on a stage was common.", "ups": 8, "depth": 1, "author": "whimsy_wanderer", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "&gt; I dunno, might just me being insecure on the internet, but I see all these impressive clears, off the wall strategies, niche playstyles, awesome achievements, and just feel... really inadequate. Never done &lt;4 operator clears, never done (x)knights stuff, so on... closest thing I've even done would just be insistence on using ops like Hellagur, Heavyrain, Passenger, etc. outside of their specific niches, and even then it's a bit of struggle. (seriously why does every new stage seemingly have elemental damage let me enjoy Musha guards or give me some sort of passive elemental heal)\n\nTo be fair, nobody shares how many hours it took to do challenging stuff like that. Probably ages for some. Although with practice you know what you can do when it comes to self-imposed challenges, it's going to take a lot of work to get there, and do it perfectly for a video.\n\nI'd think the only real advice I could give is find some comfort in the operators you use, so that you know how to tackle whatever comes along when you see it. Give yourself an opportunity to practice and learn the mechanics and hurdles that are presented to you, brainstorm the possibilities, rather than bashing your head against it. Make some goals around knowing where your weaknesses are and finding the operators that can cover that for you.\n\nI'm one that's very attached to favoritism and using high-utility, non-meta operators for the most part. While I get frustrated at times, there's only so much brainpower I'm willing to use at any one time, and I measure that against my willingness to cheese the game by borrowing broken operators. I usually don't, and prefer to do things my own way, even if I leave things undone. There's no need to force myself if it's not being fun, because what would be the point of playing it, then?\n\nI would encourage finding more operators that would mesh with what sort of playstyles you like. Challenging yourself that way, as I do, can make for a more fulfilling experience with the way you express your ideas and strategies through that. It can be difficult, but when it comes down to it it's all about what you enjoy.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, I think I got on a tangent.

{"post": {"title": "Idea: Warhammer 40k X Arknights.", "subreddit": "arknights", "selftext": "A personal concept I have about what if Warhammer 40k had a crossover with Arknights.\n\n* story:\n\nThe Imperium of Man and Chaos were fighting each other with Captain Titus of the Ultramarines leading the charge alongside Sister Miria and the Adepta Sororitas. The imperial Guard was also there with a commisar. They were assaulting Chaos Lord Drachdel's warband on a death world. They fought for days and Aeldari of Craftworld Ulthwei came to try and kill Drachdel. Meanwhile, Trazyn the Infinite was in the background, plotting and scheming to try and snatch a few good museum pieces.\n\nDuring the battle, a bunch of Orks lead by Warboss Dakkarunna came bardging in and getting a good fight in with both Imperial and Chaos forces. The collective WAAAGH! energy, Chaos sorcery, and a warpstorm transports Titus, Miria, Liris (an Eldar from craftworld Ulthwei), Trazyn, and both the Chaos and Ork forces to the world of Arknights, specifically North of Ursus and East of Sami.\n\nTitus, Miria, and Liris ended up together. Given that Liris was an Eldar, she was quickly driven from the group when Miria shot at her. Titus and Miria had to wonder the wastelands. Given that the place had a similar climate compared to the death world they were on, they assumed that all the local infected creatures were savage xenos and purged them. When they arrived at a local Sami village with some RI opperators, Miria was weirded out by the lack of Imperium iconography and the animal traits the humans have.\n\nWhen someone asks where they are from, Nobody has ever heard of the Imperium of Man. Following a poor soul asking about the Imperium and The Emperor, Miria started preaching the Lectito Divinitatus. The crowd watched in confusion at the concept of a God Emperor. RI Operators Executor, Kal'tsit, Minimalist, and Cliffheart listen to this with mixed reactions. However, everyone's thoughts were with the distant shout of WAAAGH! in the distance.\n\nDakkarunna and his boyz came and saw the Beaky and Humie coming to the village and thought that he would have a good fight here. However, only the boyz and average orks come for the village. RI and The Warhammer cast defend them and manage to push them back. RI introduces themselves to the 40k gang and they barely tolerate each other.\n\nFollowing this, the RI gang introduces them to Terra and tells them that they don't know about the God Emperor. Miria almost kills them. Eventually, Miria and Titus agree to work with the \"heretical scum and mutants of RI\" to get back to the Imperium. They started to fortify the village against the Orks. Meanwhile, Grots inform Dakkarunna about the failed raid and the big fight they could have. \n\nDakkarunna, channeling his inner Mork, decided to lure the \"Spikies\" to the village and then have an even bigger scrap. Chaos Lord Drachdel was busy trying to stop all the infighting within his chaos undivided but then finds out from the whispers of a Daemon that there is a vulnerable village full of beings to offer to the dark gods. \n\nSo, Drachdel ordered his forces to charge forth to the village to sacrifice the entirety of it to the Chaos gods. The warbands marched towards the village. Dakkarunna saw the group going towards them, decided to join in the fight. The orks and Chaos were caught in a massive battle with RI just trying to get the civilians out of the hands of the orks and Cultists. Titus and Miria explain the orks and Cultists to RI (Albeit in a very whitewashed Imperium version). Miria wanted to charge in and annihilate the Cultists and Orks in the name of the Emperor. \n\nHowever, Titus and RI force her out of it. Farseer Liris managed to find the group and also began to help the group, but she is complaining about helping cattle the whole time. Miria almost kills Liris but Executor defends her. Miria was shocked that an angel was helping a filthy Xenos but Titus makes Miria see reason with Kalt'sit wondering what the hell goes on in these people's minds. \n\nMeanwhile, Trazyn the Infinite is watching the whole thing with delight. So much history of a foreign world was going on and Trazyn was wondering what to put in his gallery. Minimalist has an encounter with the Necron but he didn't get much out of it outside of curiosity. Meanwhile, Liris was meditating alone trying to divine the future and how to get back to her craftworld. \n\nMiria was busy being held back by Monst3r so she doesn't kill Liris. In the middle of the night, Chaos and the Orks once again try to attack. However, Chaos planned for this and instead, ignored the Orks, immediately going to the village. RI and the 40K group defends the civilians while the Orks try to get Chaos's attention. However, Dakkarunna gets an idea. \"If da spikies try ta get da humies, den wez steal da humies so da spikies foit us.\"\n\nSo, Dakkarunna tries to steal the people of the village which prompts RI to attack Dakkarunna. They force Dakkarunna back and right into the clutches of Drachdel. He prepares to sacrifice the warboss along with many of the captured civilians to ascend to Daemonhood. Before he leaves, he severely injures Minimalist and Cliffheart while Miria charges the Chaos Lord with her power sword. Drachdel barely pays her attention and kills her. \n\nRI, the 40K gang, and the villagers regroup. The villagers were all shaken by the events and Titus prepares Miria's body for burial. However, a golden light envelops Miria and she rose again, engulfed by the Emperor's light. She was no longer sister Miria. She was now Saint Miria. Now with an imperial saint, Miria leads the charge towards the Chaos filth. \n\nEventually, they saw Drachdel in the middle of a ritual to sacrifice the warboss and villagers. The Warboss's boyz have come to try and get their boss back. Drachdel only sees additional sacrifices. Everyone fights as Trazyn continues to prepare as tesseract labyrinth. Drachdel ascends to become a Daemon Prince of Chaos Undivided. \n\nThey fight and it ends with Trazyn pulling a Trazyn and capturing Drachdel inside a Tesseract Labyrinth. \"I Always wanted a Daemon Prince of Chaos Undivided within Solemnace's gallary.\" Liris wants to kill him but Trazyn threatens her with becoming a museum piece. Drachdel's warband devolves into infighting and they all killed themselves. Eventually, a mini warp storm happens and the 40k gang gets sucked back in. The RI crew were all ok. \n\nWhen Captain Titus came to, he was shocked that he was alone. We cut to Solemnace and Trazyn displaying a new exhibit: Trazyn's odyssey in a strange new world. In that gallery was Drachdel, Miria, Liris, and a primaris marine standing in for Titus. \"\\*laughs\\* Perfection.\"\n\n* New operators: From various factions who just so happen to be here\n   * Captain Titus (Adeptus Astartes; Space Marines): 6 star Sentinel Protector.

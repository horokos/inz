{"post": {"title": "5 reasons why movement speed level removal is GREAT for ASA", "subreddit": "ARK", "selftext": "This is just an absolute W on all fronts:\n\n1. PVE will be significantly more challenging and immersive at all stages of the game. **In ASA, we will essentially be required to either be mounted (or have tek suit--but not so easy now) or be strapped with overwhelming heat to deal with threats on foot, at all stages of the game.**  And combine this with the TBD AI upgrades...seasoned vets might be getting bodied out there against basic creatures. Plus--some ppl don't know this, but--swim-speed is also increased by MS, cumulative with Oxygen stat. So, water shenanigans will be even more brutal in ASA than they already were.  More opportunity to be \\~=\\~immersed\\~=\\~ in FluidNinja :D\n2. Player interactions in general (PVP and PVE) will be normalized and limited only by which tames or tek items are at hand. This will make social interactions more focused on the tames and environment and less just \"ok I'll see you on the other side of the map, instantly--ZIP!\"\n3. **This is the big one: PVP will be more balanced.** The previous meta was to level movement speed to absolutely stupid degrees, especially on unofficial, to the point you basically could not be clubbed, chased down--even by gigas, nor shot by anyone without an aimbot.  Dumb as heck--need I say more?\n4. Because we can no longer kite almost anything in ASA without a tame (on official), taming will require more thought (especially factoring in the AI pathfinding upgrades) and thus be a more engaging part of the game.\n5. Early game will be more tame-focused in particular, which indirectly \"buffs\" many tames that become obsolete at later stages. This at least promotes us to interact with a bunch of stuff which in the past had no use due to the fact the player was faster than the frickin tame itself on the first evening of play, lol.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

One is to refine the development team\u2019s skills on UE5 and how far it can be pushed for next-generation titles (ARK 2).. Another factor is for business reasons. Developing a next-generation sequel while no longer releasing paid expansion packs has proven difficult for our Studio\u2019s long-term survival, so we need to continue generating revenue while we develop ARK 2. And finally, the ultimate reason: whereas ARK2 is being designed as a Souls-like adventure, we want to provide the community with an evergreen classic-ARK experience, one that can continue to grow over time on a cleaned-up code base, leveraging new technological advancements not only in the industry but also what we\u2019ve been working on with the ARK Franchise as a creative whole.\"\n\nThe big 3 whys from WC's side  boil down to;\n\n1. They need practice with UE5 before developing a brand new game in ark 2\n\n 2. They haven't had a paid release since gen 2 and they have bills to pay.\n\n3. Ark 2 is not ark, its very different. This is a rebuilt version of ark meant to exist parallel to ark 2 for those that don't like it.\n\n\nOn the player side the upside is (theoretically) cross platform with mods, new content, better performance, better graphics, and continued support. ASE was going to die in WC's eyes once ark 2 came out, now its going to be an equal to ark 2.\n\nEdit, and the DLC maps that were on ASE are all included, you don't pay for those separately.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "KLONDIKEJONES", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "They using Unreal 5 eh?

Which means they lay down in a tek sleeping pod (ideally, as the character is keep in perfect health while in one). But they don't actually log off. Instead, they open tribe log and stream it to their tribe discord. That way tribemates not online can see if someone needs to get online (their checking in to make sure tribe log doesn't say anything was killed or destroyed in a manner that looks like an attack).\n\nThis can mean that a big chunk of someone's hours could have been spent not really doing anything.

For a player like myself hours are much more closely reflective of actual time played.\n\nAnother compounding factor is that some people are allergic to reading even a linked article from a wiki or a sub 4 minute trap building video.

You have to set the server side .ini files to adjust taming speed, player stat scaling, server pass, dino growth speed, plant grow speed, mod list, etc. There's a few good online resources for the settings and what they do. Most settings are a multiplier of the base rate, and must be set as a decimal value to adjust.

Doing it on your machine is going to be a headache.  It has to be Windows or Linux based, but windows is how I am going to tell you how to do it.\n\nWhen you have your server and Windows 10 or above installed on it download ARK Server Manager from here:  [https://arkservermanager.freeforums.net/thread/5193/downloads](https://arkservermanager.freeforums.net/thread/5193/downloads) .  After you install it it will give you an interface you are going to have to get used to.  It will install the server software and the mods and configure your servers.  Each tab is a different server.  You don't have to buy a copy of ARK to set up the server.\n\nYou will be asked to make a data directory and your best bet is to do it at the root of the drive or under my documents.  This is where your servers will stay.  After installing the first thing you should do is click on the Gear Icon on the upper left.  This is where you will put in your Steam Web API Key.  Click on the button to get it, and when you get it put it in the hidden Text box.  This will help you access Steam and its services.  Don't share it around.  To save the changes made in this box you click the 'X\" in the upper right corner and now you are ready to use it.\n\nOn that tab you will be asked to set up a Profile name for the server that will show on the tab.\n\nBy default the Administration Section will allow you to name your server and that is what people will see your server as in the browser.  Then there is the Server, Admin, and Spectator Passwords.  The ports supplied on your tab by default are good for the first server, but other servers run on the same machine have to have different ports.  Each additional Server.  The way you set up these ports is available at the [Official Wiki](http://ark.wiki.gg/) under Server Configuration.  Buy like I said for your single server just use the default ports supplied.  Remember this link... it is your friend.\n\nYou then supply the map or mod map you are going to make this server.  Then you decide what mods you are going to play with.  You then can change how often the server saves a backup under Auto-Saves.  After that you can set up the Message of the Day.\n\nThen there is a check box to make it an Extinction Event Server.  This is a server that has a set reset time and is marked by an asteroid moving in closer and closer until BOOOM!!! Extinction Event.  Then the server resets.\n\nAfter that there is some key settings that are switched on and off.  Once you configured them,  technically you can install your server.  To do so you go Back to the top of the page and click the big button marked \"INSTALL\".  After you Install this will change to Verify and Update to update your server.\n\nAfter you have successfully installed your server you either click the button bellow the button you used to install the server to start and stop the server, although you could also use the coloured sphere on each tab to Start and Stop the server.\n\nThe rest you are going to have to learn the way I did.

As soon as I get to where I'm fairly well set up and I have dinos that can kill anything,.I start over.\n\nIf you WANT to do the bosses then go for it.  There are planty of guides to help speed things along and everyone has dinos I'm sure they're willing to trade very cheap or you can prob go on official and find end game dinos to take.\n\nThere is nothing to confess. You bought that game you can play it however you want. If you don't ever do any of the bosses then who cares. Are you having fun? Are you enjoying yourself?

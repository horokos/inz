The adopted parents have 9 kids all together, 6 adopted, 3 biological. There are 5 left in the house, 3 mine and 2 theirs. Their kids call me Momma kassy too and I treat them as my own as well. If I I bring gifts for my kids, I bring gifts for all the kids. If I take them for a special treat, they all come. Just like I go to my kids concerts or games I go to their kids concerts and games. They consider me another mom. \n\nMy bio mom abandoned us one at a time. My mom and dad got divorced when I was 1 ans both remarried soon after. My mom and step dad abandoned my siblings then when I was the last left in the house the abuse got worse for me and I was thrown out. Then my step mom would kick me out and tell my dad I ran away, he ever believed me. Then one night I was dropped off at my aunts for the weekend and they never came back, one day my stuff was dropped off in my aunts driveway. I was being sexually abused by my cousin and finally got the courage to tell my aunt, she kicked me out, called me a liar. I went to my grandmothers who lived down the street and my cousin still came there to sexually abuse me, so it wa either stay and be SAd every night or take to the streets again. I bounced around at friends houses then slept in cars, abandoned buildings, outside. I eventually realized if I slept with a guy I'd have somewhere to sleep at night and maybe some food. Shoplifted my food and clothes. It's a very very Long story from there but when I got pregnant t at 17, I was working 3 jobs and went to night school , i was homeless until 5 months along when I bought a trailer off a crackhead for 200$ so I had a place to live when the baby was born.", "ups": 190, "depth": 1, "author": "WhySoGlum1", "replies": [{"selftext": "Your life story starts insanely sad.

Avoid residential areas if you want to start a noisy business like a bar.

I was adopted into this family when I was a young child, and right from the start, I never quite felt like I truly belonged. As the years went by, the disparities in the way I was treated compared to my adoptive siblings became more and more evident. Initially, the differences were subtle. I didn't receive the same level of affection and/or special privileges as my siblings. While my brother and sister were sent to a prestigious private school, I was enrolled in the local public school.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the most glaring injustices was the monthly allowance my siblings received. It seemed like a small thing, but it spoke volumes about how they were valued over me. I was never given any pocket money, and when I asked for it, I was met with dismissive remarks from mom and dad. Birthdays were another painful reminder of my place in the family. My siblings would receive extravagant gifts, and their parties were grand affairs. But when it was my turn, my parents always had some excuse for not celebrating. Instead, they'd leave me with a list of chores, expecting me to spend the day cleaning the house and taking care of everyone else.\r  \n\r  \nDespite the unfair treatment, I found solace in reading and writing. It was my escape from the harsh reality of my home life. I dreamed of becoming an author, of creating worlds and stories that would resonate with people. Recently, my parents asked each of us about our future endeavors. My sister mentioned law, following in our father's footsteps, and my brother wanted to be a hip-hop musician. My parents gushed over their ambitions, offering support and encouragement. Then, it was my turn.\r  \n\r  \nI nervously admitted that I wanted to be an author. The reaction was like a punch to the gut. My family burst into condescending laughter, and my dad, a lawyer himself, delivered the final blow. He scoffed at my dream, telling me I'd never make a living writing books. He even joked that I would serve as the family nanny for the rest of my life. The words stung, but they also lit a fire within me. I was devastated, but I was also determined. I decided that I couldn't let my family's prejudice and disapproval define my future. I made a promise to myself; that I will prove them wrong. With newfound motivation, I set out to launch an internet store and publish my authored works.

Does it make you sad?", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "Pappyjang", "replies": [{"selftext": "*TLDR Edit at the bottom*\n\nNo, and to be honest I don't like when people feel sad for me either. Pitying me just makes me feel like I'm different and not accepted and looked down upon and I'll never be normal or equal. I can (and do) 99% of things able-bodied people do, so I don't really see why I have to be treated or seen like a sick puppy. I would confidently argue I actually can do *more* than able-bodied people since I practically do everything they do, *plus* my own wheelchair skills. I can't walk or jump, but that's pretty much it. And my wheelchair acts as my legs and transportation, so there isn't much difference. I can't reach certain things, but neither can short and average height people. There are only minor differences to better adapt to my situation, but everyone has to adapt to their life. What matters is your *mentality*, that will hinder you far more than your physical state... in my opinion.\n\nSo I would say no, what do I have to be sad about? I will be driving soon, I work, I go to school, I go on vacations, I have friends, hobbies, interests, family, I have as normal of a life as anyone else. Being in a wheelchair isn't holding me back in any way, and has made me a more well-rounded individual I think. I can adapt, problem-solve, think outside of the box, have empathy, determination, and be grateful for my life. It's been a little more of a challenging life, but that's given me ways to learn and grow more than some other people.\n\nBeing treated or seen in a pitiful way just frustrates me and makes me feel like an outsider. Assuming someones capabilities based off their looks without knowing anything about them or being educated on the topic isn't exactly fair to them. It's natural, everyone (for the most part) does it and there is rarely ever ill-intent attached with it, but I will say it is one of my biggest pet peeves. Society acts like they want to begin making disabled individuals seen and treated as equal. Yet often times, they do the opposite by not viewing or treating us as an absolute equal. And this change in behavior to me compared to an able-bodied individual, even if with good intentions, is noticeable and makes me think \"if they want me to feel equal they why are they treating me differently?\"\n\nI've discussed this with several other disabled individuals and our consensus has always been: We hate when people feel sad for us. It makes us feel the opposite of equal. It makes us feel like we'll never be enough because people take one look and we're already being downplayed despite zero knowledge on the situation. And it makes us feel frustrated that we're constantly underestimated when our life is not really any different than anyone else's.\n\n**Edit: Disabled people just want to be and feel accepted. We do not feel accepted when being pitied and treated differently. Like most things, media (tv, movies, social media, etc) is not indicative of *real life*. Every disability is different and every person is different.**\n\n**Ask, don't assume.**", "ups": 1, "depth": 1, "author": "Cerulean225", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "Hi there.

For me personally, I'd rather struggle a little and try to figure it out for the future, than to instantly give up, you know. But one easy tell-tale sign for me when I might need help is looking around for anyone nearby. Otherwise, even if I look like I'm struggling a bit, I might be but *ask* if I need help before just rushing in because I might be trying to figure it out. Or, often people rush to open a door for me, not realizing I was using the door to push myself forward so when they open it, I just lose balance and don't get good momentum. So I'd say overall, ask before taking action. When asking, obviously don't do it in a condescending way. I am much more receptive when people ask in a general sense, as if they'd ask anyone - not just me because I'm disabled. And also, if they agree for help, maybe ask to be directed what to do? Because help is nice, but if not done correctly then it could make things more challenging.

Is it different depending on quality of hotel?", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "shelforder21", "replies": [{"selftext": "What do you mean by taking stuff?\n\nI'll answer both angles I think your asking. We only take items from room if a guest is due to check out, passed checkout time, and we contacted the guest but they didn't answer. Now the process I do is I always go up to the room with a second person as a witness. I film the room when I enter, film the items as found, and then on video pack up all items. I say aloud the items I see as I'm packing. Still on video once complete I have my witness scan the room for any items I may have missed. Then i do one last scan and the video ends with us leaving the room. I also write down all items I found/packed up. We then call the guest and if they answer inform them their items are at the desk or if they don't answer we leave a voice-mail. When the guest comes back I provide the video. \n\nSecond angle, theft. So actually theft in rooms at least the hotels I've worked at is very uncommon. I've only had one case in my 7 years and the housekeeper was immediately terminated after the investigation. Now I've fired plenty of restaurant employees and lounge attendants who have stolen. Overcharged guests, took items they left behind in restaurant/lounge, etc. I once had a bartender and a kitchen supervisor working together on overcharging then pocketing the overcharge from guests. I caught it because I was looking at the F&amp;B reports and noticed the profit didn't match the drawer. Then I uncovered it. The amount was like over $10,000 dollars. The only reason I caught it because the kitchen manager was MIA and my Director of F&amp;B needed help. I still think to this day this kitchen manager was in on it too because if he was reviewing the reports daily he would have seen it too.\n\nI would say it doesn't come down to quality of hotel it comes down to management.\n\nEdit: we also take items from guest rooms if its something very illegal but even then we call police to have them handle it.", "ups": 1, "depth": 1, "author": "gingybutt", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "Pursuing a career in the hotel industry is one of my passions.

Me and my gf never really had a wild sexual life, it\u2019s boring and bland in my taste, but she likes vanilla sex so I guess I don\u2019t mind.

Sex has gone down to twice a month at best, we our both in our twenties, also I\u2019ve just been recently became disabled, so money is tight but her support is nonexistent, I\u2019ve lost 160lb and gain lots of muscle I know I look good now. I rarely go thru her phone but she\u2019s been very protective over it. The other night I was trying to unlock her old disabled phone, I told her I might need her phone and password. Instead she came to work on it with me and wouldn\u2019t let me touch her phone. When I got mad and told her how I felt about this she went to the other room, came back like 7 minutes after to hand me the phone. Another thing is when we talk or argue she just walks away from an argument instead of trying to fix it and acts like nothing happens later.

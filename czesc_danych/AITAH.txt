These are legal documents for which the teacher is legally mandated to follow. Since these protections deal with medical and psychological issues, they fall under HIPAA. The teacher is unable to tell other students why they are not enforcing the normal rules. This makes things challenging for the teacher when students without these protections push back. In the case of airpods, the student may have a  sensitivity to certain sounds that white noise helps to alleviate. They may have extremely high anxiety, and music on very low volumes can help to relieve the anxiety. They may have high functioning autism and music or sounds played through the airpods may relieve auditory discomfort or social anxiety and help them participate.

I appreciate it!**\r\n\nGiven that we are in the same res and share several classes (and a 3-hour Monday lab), I have been catching some glimpses of Thomas from time to time throughout the week. I saw him a lot on Monday given our lab, but we didn't speak.\r\n\nThroughout the rest of the week, I didn't see him too much and was starting to think things would end there. That was until Thursday night. I was hanging out in the dining area of the res, catching up on some readings. It was around 9 pm, so the area was largely empty.\r\n\nAbout 15 minutes into my readings, I saw Thomas and who I\u2019m assuming is his roommate, walking around (I think they were just grabbing some food or something). I continued doing my readings, and then I just saw him (I guess his roommate left by this stage) standing pretty close by. When I looked at him, he asked if he could speak with me. I said fine. The only reason I think I did bother listening to him was because I felt faintly bad for lashing out the previous weekend.\r\n\nHe told me that he was very sorry for bothering me in the gym when I appeared busy, and he should have known that I\u2019d still have reservations about talking with him given how he treated me in the past. He went on for a good few minutes about how terrible he was and how much grace I had for even speaking with him for the past few weeks. \n\nThen he started saying things like how there were no excuses for his behaviour and so on. I asked him that if he thought there were no excuses, then why did he picked on me. Since I was a pretty quiet kid, I said that he probably thought I was an easy target. He denied this and just became quiet around this stage.\r\n\nI asked again, and then he said that he did it because he liked me \u201cfor a very long time,\u201d were his exact words. He also said he wanted me to go out with him last weekend so that he could apologize more formally because he respected me.\r\n\nI will admit, I felt really annoyed at this stage, so I told him his apparent feelings were a cop-out and that he probably thought it would make me forgive him. I told him that him telling me this made my stomach churn. He looked a little surprised at this and didn\u2019t say anything. I then told him that if he had any of his so-called respect for me, he\u2019d keep his distance.\r\n\nHe agreed and said that he was sorry for bothering me again. Friday passed by pretty smoothly, and I don\u2019t remember seeing him at all, so hopefully, he got the message.\r", "ups": 469, "permalink": "/r/AITAH/comments/16q34o0/update_aita_for_calling_my_former_bully_beyond/", "num_comments": 69}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I don\u2019t know why boys who have crushes pull their pigtails but it\u2019s a common trope.

{"post": {"title": "AITA for hurting my father's mistress/wife?", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "When I was 20, my family found out that my dad was cheating on my mom with our maid.  They obviously got divorced but since he stated that he was in love with the maid the entire family did everything they could to secure our family wealth. Dad was disowned by his parents and bottom line he was left with nothing.\n\nAfter all of this I was really traumatized and bitter. This was my dad, my man role model, my hero and he was also the one to destroy our family. I admit that he tried really hard to keep contact with me and to explain to me that he still loved me very much and it had nothing to do with me but I did not want anything to do with him. I cut him off entirely and refused any kind of communication with him for the past 9 years. Back then I told him that he was dead to me and for his sake he should consider the same, pretend he did not have a biological daughter anymore and go play house with his whore and her bastard daughter. I know he still kept tabs on my life and each year he would send me messages on Christmas and my birthday but I never responded. \n\n6 months ago I had a bad accident. I was driving home when a drunk driver hit me full force. The doctors let my family know that the injuries that I sustained were really bad and that they were doing everything in thier power to save my life but they should be prepared for everything. Luckily I fully recovered (since I am now here lol) but my dad has been insane ever since in trying to mend our relationship. He came to the hospital almost every day while I stayed there but me refusing to see him did not make him understand that I want nothing to do with him. \n\nI recently changed my mind and decided to comfront him and his mistress (now wife) because some relatives told me what the woman has been saying about me and my family. She has been talking shit saying that it is not my fault for acting like this because I learnt this from my family (mom &amp; grandparents) and they are to blame for me being cruel. After hearing this I could not believe the audacity of this whore so I agreed to meet my dad and her and set things straight. I think they got the wrong impression because when I went to meet them, they came along with the daughter and her husband. They were so disgusting. The woman had a stupid smile on her face and told me how happy she is that after all this time I was giving them a chance and how happy she is that her daughter will finally have the 'sister' she always wanted. I made it clear that I am not giving them any chance. I told her that I know everything she has been saying and if I learnt cruelty from my family, than her daughter must have learnt from her that being a whore and sucking your boss makes you progress in life. I also told her that thanks God she does not have an utherus anymore so she cannot taint my bloodline with her creatures. I told the girl's husband to watch out because what can be expected from such disgusting women. Before leaving I told my dad that he has 2 options: either consider me dead or divorce his joke of a wife, cut ties with that joke of a family and come back into our lives. He told me that he cannot let me go, that I am his daughter and that last years have been torture not being close to me. Again I told him that if he expects forgiveness, he knows what to do and if he really loved me that much, he will chose me this time. \n\nMy grandparents agreed with my actions and are hopeful that maybe their son will come back to his senses and come back to his family. But one of my aunts (dad's SIL) said that it was a low blow for me to mention her incapacity of having more children, that I may have hurt her with my words. Honestly, I do not care. She hurt me more when she destroyed my family so her struggles or hurt do not move me at all.

They can:  \nBecome impatient or angry when they don't receive special recognition or treatment.  \nHave major problems interacting with others and easily feel slighted.  \nReact with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior.  \nHave difficulty managing their emotions and behavior.  \nExperience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change.  \nWithdraw from or avoid situations in which they might fail.  \nFeel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection.  \nHave secret feelings of insecurity, shame, humiliation and fear of being exposed as a failure.  \nWhen to see a doctor  \nPeople with narcissistic personality disorder may not want to think that anything could be wrong, so they usually don't seek treatment. If they do seek treatment, it's more likely to be for symptoms of depression, drug or alcohol misuse, or another mental health problem. What they view as insults to self-esteem may make it difficult to accept and follow through with treatment.  \nIf you recognize aspects of your personality that are common to narcissistic personality disorder or you're feeling overwhelmed by sadness, consider reaching out to a trusted health care provider or mental health provider.

As we got older and had families, we would see each other at least once a month, sometimes more frequently. \n\nAfter we graduated college, her parents wanted to live on the beach, so they bought one of those huge houses that sleeps twenty, in-ground pool, right on the water, etc. They would live there nine months of the year and then rent it out in summer months while they traveled. My friend met her husband here and got married and had kids, so she didn\u2019t relocate with her parents. She was a SAHM and her husband\u2019s job is remote, so they would frequently visit her parents at their beach house.  On a couple of occasions over the years, she has mentioned hosting large gatherings at her parent\u2019s beach house, including her kids\u2019 fraternity spring breaks, as well as a few of her other friends.\n\n Fast forward to today. Allison\u2019s parents are in assisted living and have sold the beach house. My daughter and her husband have done well for themselves and purchased a modest home on a beach (other side of the country from where my friend went).  My husband and I visit them and also sometimes house sit when they\u2019re traveling.  I didn\u2019t think anything about telling Allison about our travel plans, but now she\u2019s dropping heavy hints about how much she misses spending time at the beach. What\u2019s worse, when I see her adult kids, they also ask about when they\u2019re going to get an invite. \n\nI have no intention of inviting Allison or her family to my daughter\u2019s beach house. Even if my daughter was okay with it, I still wouldn\u2019t invite them to the house. I was never invited to her parent\u2019s beach house in the 30 years they had one, so I don\u2019t feel obligated to invite Allison and her family now that I have access to one. I\u2019m not angry about never being invited, it was her parent\u2019s house, and even though she invited other friends, that\u2019s her decision. Not my house, not my rules.

My friend then noticed the new couple were missing for some time and we knew they didn\u2019t leave. So me and her went looking around since we had a good idea what was going on.

She\u2019s not one for confrontation. \n\nAfter a few minutes of them not coming out I opened the door and they were still in bed doing it. I yelled get out but then saw her pants on the floor. I grabbed them and took them to the front door and threw them out into the yard. Everyone was what\u2019s going on and laughing. We waited for them. \n\nEventually they sheepishly came out looking all embarrassed. She had his hoodie tied around her waist. People were laughing again and the guy asked where her pants and underwear were. So I told him outside and he called me an asshole for doing that and I said well don\u2019t fuck on someone\u2019s bed. They left. \n\nIt was a bit divided on how I reacted. I felt I was standing up for my friend for being disrespected like that. Especially since this girl was essentially a stranger to the group.

{"post": {"title": "(UPDATE 2)", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "(UPDATE)\n\n\nIm gonna clarify some things and answer the most asked questions \n\n1) Do I intend to stay with my wife? No, I've already decided on divorce\n2) Why do I refer to My wife son as \"our son\" and my daughter as \"My daughter\" My daughter doesn't call my wife mom she calls her by her name, which makes sense since her mom is still very involved in her life. Naturally, I'd refer to my daughter as \"my daughter.\" As for my exes son, I've known him since he was 7, and he didn't have any farther figure in his life he calls me dad and I treat like my own. I thought it would be easier to understand throughout the story.\n3) Why won't my daughter just cook her own food? Well if yall read the story throughly yall would see where I said that my wife admitted to not buying most my daughter's grocery list. This Of course limits the food my daughter can cook and eat herself. She believes that it's a waste of money and should be used on snacks her son prefers and extra food.\n4) how bad is my daughters relationship with her bio mom? My daughter and her bio mom relationship is very good she's never been neglectful towards her from what i know of. She lived with her bio mom from ages (12-15) I think she's keen on staying with Me to try a different arrangement and get a break from her bio mom as I know she Can be a little crazy.  And I mean that in a good way.\n5) Why doesn't my daughter she eat the food my wife makes instead of throwing a fit? It's not as simple as just eating the food. She gets physically ill. Seriously we try every now and then to expand her palette (no luck) she literally will gag and vomit the food. \n6) Am I going to let her pay for her own groceries? Absolutely not. A child shouldn't have to worry about making sure they can eat no matter what age they are. That's the parent Job. \n7) how is my wife only going grocery shopping for a while month? On the first of every money my wife goes grocery shopping with our budget being 1k- 1.5k \n8) my work schedule: 5am- 9pm. Off on weekends and holidays.\n9) Why am I letting my daughter leave instead of my wife?  My daughter has a choice to stay with me or her mother she's choosing to stay with me. My wife will be the one leaving once the divorce is finalized. \n10) have I told my wife or the kids that I've decided on divorce ? No , not tonight. I will be having a sit down with both my kids separately and one with everyone together.\n\nI do teach my daughter how to manage her money. My daughter is a junior so she is usually busy with a lot, she also plays soccer, volleyball, and is on the student council at her school. She shouldn't have to worry about having a meal to eat when she gets home. Not saying that she to young to go grocery shopping herself. But you get the point. My daughter isn't upset with my wife. She sympathizing with her because she knows it difficult to accommodate someone with her taste pallete and Is still insisting that I give my wife another chance.  Which is heartbreaking because my wife openly admitted to putting her own son needs before my daughters. Which I'm not mad at. protect yours right? But still I don't play favorites with her son and my daughter and if our roles were reversed I'd bend over backwards to accommodate him. People are also confused on how I didn't notice before. My wife always told me that she made a separate meal for my daughter which I believed. I mean I had no reason not to. And my daughter is a huge people pleaser so of course she didn't say anything probably because she was scared to drive a bridge between me and my wife.  And for the narrow-minded people saying that my daughter is being dramatic think of it as you being forced to eat something you are extremely allergic to. You wouldn't want to and you shouldn't be forced to. \nPeople are saying that my wife's neglect towards our daughter is far more serious so I'm going to put my daughter in therapy because I know she won't just come out and say what other issues her and my wife have been having. My daughter isn't literally going hungry she has a job. Still she shouldn't be spending money on takeout every night. Me not forcing my to eat for she can't keep down isn't me spoiling her and for the people saying she should just suck it up need to seek help. I feel extremely guilty as parent for not seeing my daughter was being neglected sooner and I hope my relationship with her can he fixed.\n \nI'm also going to look into all the conditions yall are saying my daughter might have.

{"post": {"title": "We left my mum at home and went on a family holiday", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "So I know the title definitely makes me and my family sound like the asshole here but please bear with. In August , me and my family scheduled a holiday to a place in France. We have been going there for years but because of Covid haven\u2019t been since 2019. Important context is that my mum always kicks up a fuss about going on holiday here , despite her never liking any other solutions , or never working with the family to find a different place that she would be happy going to. For example one year  we organised all together , a holiday  to a five star hotel in Germany , but she still complained about how it wasn\u2019t exactly up to her standards, and what she had envisioned despite being happy at the time of planning and booking . She  also always starts arguments the day of us leaving to go.  \n\nIn the morning of the day we are supposed to go, I come downstairs and I can hear my mum and dad shouting, at which point he comes out onto the landing . Now I may have been wrong for how I said this but I asked him \u201c what\u2019s wrong now\u201d . My mum hears this storms out of the room she\u2019s in to yell at me. Turns out an hour before we are going she\u2019s decided that there is some important work thing she needs to get sorted. ( I will explain more about that in a little ). In an effort to help I follow her , apologise and ask what she needs . She explains that she\u2019s trying to print off a document, but she\u2019s having difficulties so I ask to see her computer. She immediately gets defensive and asks why would I need that I can just help her, and on top of this I notice that she\u2019s using an old computer that my brother used to own rather than her work computer . I promise I won\u2019t look at what she\u2019s doing but will help, and we go back to the study to try and sync this laptop with the printer. My dad comes in and she immediately closes the laptop to stop him seeing it, and screams at him to get out. After a while of trying nothing seems to be working so I ask my brother,  who is good with computers to have a look. When he fails to help she looks at him dead and says something along the lines of \u201c why do you have to be  so autistic\u201d, and comments on how useless I am. Important to note my brother is not autistic, and she says this to be in her terms insulting. She then screams that she doesn\u2019t want to come on holiday, never did, and to take her bags out of the car and leave. Which we then did. \n\nTo circle quickly back to her work thing , turns out she was lying about what she was doing, and was drafting a letter in an attempt to get someone disbarred because of a disagreement  and a general dislike for someone she worked with. \n\nShe has since cried , said she will never forgive any of us for leaving her all alone , and expects apologies for our atrocious and callous behaviour, even though we did offer to buy her train tickets and pick her after we got there and considered how hurt she was . She had been blowing up everyone\u2019s phones after she found out we took her word seriously and left . \n\nI told this to my friend genuinely thinking that although unpleasant what we did had been a long time coming or a straw that broke the camels back moment  , but my friend thought we went too far and were assholes for leaving her . \nSo AITAH for taking my mum at her word and going on holiday without her ?\n\nEdit : I am super overwhelmed by the amount of support and consideration this post has got , and I am working on responding to all comments . So genuinely for the time being till I can fully respond thank you for caring enough to actually give perspective\n\nEdit 2 : if I don\u2019t respond to everyone I\u2019m very sorry, but I appreciate and care about your opinion and support , it\u2019s helped me realise I really need to find myself a Job asap , but more asap than I\u2019ve been thinking . I appreciate all the comments . It means so much people have taken time out of their day to weight in. The burden of making another person feel so awful is sitting less heavy on me now knowing it\u2019s genuinely a case of just doing what was asked for .

{"post": {"title": "My daughter showed up to my house asking for money. Help don't know what to do", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "\n\nMe (45f) needs help with this situation, the title seems very alarming I know but let me explain. My ex-husband (47m) and I moved in together while we were still in college. We both finished college and started exploring the world until I found out I was pregnant, we were so happy to find out we were having a baby. 4 months into my pregnancy he proposed to me, I was so happy that day.\n\n\n\n\nI know this long for me to explain but I'm trying to get all the details in so you guys can understand me, skip to 13 years later. We are married and have our daughter 13 and we are happy until the next day was ruined. I found out he was cheating on me with my ex-best friend, I told him to get out and pack everything he had. After he left it was just my daughter and I, I made calls to get a lawyer for divorce papers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 12 months I was finally divorced, I didn't know it could take that long. But he did put me on child support, I don't know why when I make less than him. My daughter would go house from house on the weekends, this week was my week. My daughter didn't show up and I found that weird, I called her but she didn't answer so I called her dad, he told me she doesn't want to come over this week. I found it strange because she would always be excited to come over to my house, this happened for months. \n\n\n\n\nOne day I get a call from my daughter saying she would like to come over and I was so happy, when she got to the house I asked her why she didn't see me. She told me that she was spending time with her dad's new girlfriend, I did feel a kinda way. She told me that her dad's girlfriend is pretty, rich and cool. I was neither of those things because to be honest I was struggling to make money and get back on my feet but I was doing it for my daughter.\n\n\n\nThen before I know it, my daughter didn't show up again. She went 3 months without contacting me when I call many times, this is where it gets bad. Her dad came to my house and gave me papers in a yellow envelope, he left before I asked what it was. It was papers for parental rights, I tried calling him again asking what was it for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis situation is still new and will be happy with all your guys kind words, in court sat my ex-husband,my daughter and my ex husband girlfriend smiling at me. I felt heartbroken, it was time for me to sign the papers but I wouldn't until I got to talk to my daughter. When I got to talk to her I cried and asked her if they were making her do this, she told me no and that she rather have her step mom for her mom because she had more money than me and was prettier than me. As a mother I thought I gave her everything, even when I didn't have much money I would steal her her what she needs. I begged her to not do this, my own daughter yelled at me and told me to sign the damn papers. I don't know what I did wrong for her to feel that way, we say in the court room for 7 hours because I wouldn't sign the papers. It was until her dad came into the court room yelling at me to hurry up, my daughter jumped in telling me the same. The judge has to come back in and give the Final words\n\n\n\n\n\nI know you guys might think am the A hole but I signed the papers to make them happy, all three of them jumped up happy, my daughter looked even more happy. She even told her step mom she is her new mommy. I left the court room crying, when I got back home I wouldn't stop crying. I still texted her for 7 months after the situation but she never responded so I stopped. I felt like I had no purpose in life and tried to end it all but something in me told me I had more I life.I wanted to fix myself so I started going to therapy and that's when I found my now husband. He was my therapist, he's a good and caring man. He tells me how much he loves me every day.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it's been 5 years since I had no contact with my child, every years when it was her birthday I would still tell her I love her. I would text her but she wouldn't respond, I think I was blocked. I'm living better, I don't have money problems anymore. I'm now married to my husband (46m), we have twin girls that are age 7. The twins make us so happy, we go to so many countries. We're going on a trip to England for the girls birthday.\n\n\n\n\nIt was the day of our family trip to England, it was around 8:34 when we began to get ready. We back the day before but we did forget somethings, my husband and I got the kids ready. I was in the kitchen packing their lunch because I know they don't like air plane food, I packed up the kids bag and sat it next to the door until I heard a knock. I looked through my peephole to see a young women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I opened the door and it was my daughter, even after years she looked the same. She looked so drained, I asked her how did she find me and what did she want. She began crying and telling me that her father has lung cancer and she has no money, I asked her what about her step mom and she told me she left and took all her dad money, so she asked me if I can pay for his surgery. I was stuck in the moment because I didn't know what to do, I told her I have to think about because I'm going on a trip and will be out the house for a month. She didn't care about what I said and told me I should pay since I have the money now, I didn't know where all this was coming from but I shut the door in front of her face. Yes that was rude but I am not obligated to pay for my ex husband surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAITA? I am still on my trip so when I have the time I will trying and update on the situation, I do apologize for this being so long.\n\n\n\n\nEdited: for the ones saying it's fake it is not, I know this doesn't sound believable and very unrealistic but trust me it's real. I found out that my daughter found my number and house on my Facebook. And to clear things up the judge did give me a word too, it was only if I was unfit to be a mother. I was not unfit to be a mother only money problems but what my daughter and her dad talked about couldn't help me out the situation.", "ups": 33, "permalink": "/r/AITAH/comments/16qc0k2/my_daughter_showed_up_to_my_house_asking_for/", "num_comments": 76}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Well, from a legal standpoint, you signed away your parental rights to your first daughter, at the insistence, of your ex-husband, his girlfriend, and your daughter herself - because, as she said to you, her stepmom had more money.

{"post": {"title": "AITAH for not taking my wife on a \u201cdedicated\u201d Honeymoon", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "So I (30M) married my wife (25F) in early June. I deeply love and cherish her and while I make a very handsome income, she has never asked me for anything expensive nor expects/demands any gifts. Usually it\u2019s me who pushes her to get something or is buying things for her, sometimes despite her protest that we should have saved that money.\n\nWe had planned to go on a honeymoon but because my job is very demanding I couldn\u2019t get the time off. I barely got two weeks time off for my wedding which is not nearly enough time in my culture since family members on both sides invite the new couple to dinners and lunches, and we had to skip quite a few of relatives on both sides. She mentioned it was not even close to the wedding she had imagined (she wanted us to take a month so we could visit each relative - family is very very important to her) but marrying me was more important than the ideal wedding so we went through with it even with the short time.\n\nFast forward to mid July, I get an unexpected offer from a potential employer whom I was networking with for the past year or so. They had a sudden departure and thought I would be a perfect replacement. I immediately accepted, put in my two weeks notice, and asked my new employer to delay my start until mid Sept because I want to take some time off (the wedding two weeks was the only time off I got from my last employer for the two years I was there).\n\nWe took the time off to do a two week west-coast trip, a one week east-coast trip and a week in Hawaii. I made sure to include everything she told me she wanted to visit/do in the past such as Disney and Universal Studios in LA, visiting Solvang, trying scuba diving etc. and we planned the trip together. I thought this was the honeymoon but admit I could have communicated more properly.\n\nFast forward to this week I come home early from the office and hear my wife on a video call in our bedroom with her 3 friends with whom she practically grew up with and went to both school and college with. I didn\u2019t meant to eavesdrop and would have let my wife know I was home when I hear her friends calling me an AH for not giving my wife a proper honeymoon especially after I had a rushed wedding. My wife defended me saying that we did a whole month worth travelling when I did get the time but her friends said that I was cheap for not doing a dedicated, expensive honeymoon to a tropical destination with business class tickets etc. especially since I make close to $500k a year and could have easily afforded it. That honeymoons need to planned in advance, be labelled as a honeymoon etc. At this point I make some noise outside and my wife realizes I\u2019m home and ends the call. She doesn\u2019t realize I heard anything.\n\nThis was honestly a shock to me so I spoke to the family. My SILs feel the same way as wife\u2019s friends and think I am AH for not doing more. They say that my wife has had to face bullying in their family because I make so much but had a rushed wedding and now \u201ccheaped out\u201d on the honeymoon. Mind you, our trip was by no means cheap but I felt horrible that my wife had to hear her relatives say that to her face (she never mentioned it to me). My BIL, MIL and brothers think my wife\u2019s friends and SILs are being too dramatic and we shouldn\u2019t care what relatives think, especially since we did go on a long trip that we both planned. My parents took a pretty neutral stance and said while that can be the honeymoon I should have communicated that before the trip. I spoke to my wife about it and she said she agrees that was the honeymoon, but she has been a bit quiet and generally a little down since then.\n\nI\u2019m now super confused. I can\u2019t get time off anytime soon since I just started this job, and I am not sure whether I just messed up.", "ups": 145, "permalink": "/r/AITAH/comments/16px8lo/aitah_for_not_taking_my_wife_on_a_dedicated/", "num_comments": 106}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I get that culture, in some cultures, plays a huge role in the day to day of things but honestly, if you both agree that was honeymoon, and you're only married to each other, does it really matter what other people think?

{"post": {"title": "AITAH for telling my ex-MIL that she should be ashamed of herself as a woman and that I don't know if I trust her to be a positive example for my daughter.", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "So I'm not sure where to start, there's so much to the story but I'll do my best to paint a clear picture. My(33F) ex(33M) and Father of my child(4F) was physically and emotionally abusive. Thank God I escaped from his clutches, unfortunately I share a daughter with him. When I left him he ended up selling our old house and moved in with his mom to help her and save money himself. Through out our relationship my mil's and my relationship fluctuated up and down but at the end of the day I considered her family. My own mom is deceased, infact I don't have any living relatives to speak of, so I would often confide in or seek advice from my mil like I would my own mom. For a long time I hid the abuse. It eventually got so bad that I let it start to slip what he was doing. There were a few times I reached out for help or advice and I was met with disbelief or round about ways of putting the blame on me. This made me feel so trapped and scared to reach out for help with anyone due to fear of rejection or judgement for so long. Definitely helped keep me trapped longer than I probably would have, however that's on me.\n\nAnyways, so since my ex and I separated my ex and her try to act like I can't be trusted to be a mother to my daughter on my own. She condemns me for things like the old house being a mess towards the end. Constantly. I finally snapped the other day and said that I am insulted by the way I'm constantly being talked down to over a messy house. A messy house!!! What about the mess your own son made of my body, am I less than a house?!?! How could I keep a clean house when I'm too busy trying to survive the daily war with my ex. She responded by saying it is my own fault for staying. \n\nThis is when I finally said that I honestly didn't know if I feel like I want her to be a female influence to my daughter. Yes I stayed longer than I should have and by doing that I let my daughter down and allowed her to witness the abuse. But that is my guilt to carry, and I will spend the rest of my life making sure I teach her that if the day ever comes where a man puts hands on her, she won't be like me, she will walk away. \n\nBut everything they do and say shows otherwise. Basically my ex mil is the type of woman that protects the abuser and blames the victim. Her own father was extremely abusive to her mom and I'll never forget a comment she made about how her mom stayed because she was weak. WEAK! Her own mother! But she'll talk so highly of her Dad.\nSo yes, I told her that she should be ashamed of herself as a woman and that I don't want her influencing my little girl to think that way. I know my ex is her son but my daughter is her granddaughter and a toddler. If she really wants what is best for my kid then shouldn't we work together to show my daughter that it is unacceptable for any man to abuse a female the way her son did to me. Instead of making excuses, enabling, shifting blame on the victim, and denying the truth? \nI hope this makes sense, there's so much to the story, I don't know how to properly communicate it all. But if it's understandable at all what do you guys think? Idk, maybe I am wrong. Maybe I'm expecting too much. I just don't know.

My family never struggled with money so i got Henry enroled in a pretty good primary school, and out of all the kids in there he chose to be friends with Nancy.\n\nNancy had bad grades, was a liar and didnt get along with anyone.

However, I don\u2019t expect us to have a close friendship in the future.\n\nI also checked up on Liam. As I\u2019ve said before, I adore my husband and do not want to make him feel bad. I asked him if he felt hurt by what I said. He says yes he was deeply offended and I should make up for it with a thousand kisses plus interest starting right now.\n\nThe worst thing in my life right now is my baby kicking up into my ribs. I miss being able to breathe without a foot in my organs.\n\nSeveral people have questioned how I got the reputation of being thoughtful when I made really bad personal decisions. Honestly, I\u2019m fiscally responsible, organized, and all around a prepared person. But I am dependent on having a stable, boring life and was unequipped to have my personal life fall apart.\n\nIf I think back to what I was like 10 years ago, I had a good amount of savings, a comfortable career and close friends. I also had a fianc\u00e9 who I had been with for years and who had changed into a person I no longer recognized. Someone who lied to me, stole from me and cheated on me.\n\nLiam actually was the one who called me after Dave broke up with me. He told me about how Dave had lied to him and used him in lies and was with the other woman. I was still in shock.\n\nHe came over to give me some things that Dave had left at his apartment in case it was mine. Some of it was mine, some of it was Dave\u2019s trash. I sobbed and blamed him and he took it and apologized. He kissed me. I said I wanted to ruin his life like he ruined mine. Liam saw Dave as his best friend. He also had trust issues so lying is off the table. Their friendship was already ruined but I didn\u2019t know that. I was not good at getting revenge, at least spontaneously .\n\nWe didn\u2019t use protection. I had been told I was infertile. My previous two partners (my old boyfriend and Dave) never got me pregnant after years. I was ignorant and wasn\u2019t told that infertile doesn\u2019t mean sterile. I still had a chance of getting pregnant.\n\nHaving a child out of wedlock is very uncommon and looked down upon, even more than divorce. Because of that, shotgun weddings are actually pretty common.\n\nI was excited to be a mother and Liam was, to my surprise, excited to be a father. We decided to put aside our old grievances, be friends, and raise our child happily. I can say that I stated falling in love with him through my pregnancy but it was solidified after my birth. It was traumatic and I tore badly. Liam was such an attentive husband and father. We fell together so nicely it was hard to notice when he became my soulmate.\n\nPart of the reason I hated Liam was that the way we expressed love was too similar. I need quality time and attention and he needed quality time and affection. There\u2019s no limit to the amount of time we want to spend with loved ones. Dave was an introvert who valued time alone. When it was Dave in the middle, I felt as though Liam was stealing my limited time with him. Now, it feels nice to have a partner that values and expresses the same kind of love. We are around each other constantly. Liam needs at least an uninterrupted hour a day and more on weekends of my attention solely on him. We could spend entire days just snuggling and kissing.\n\nWe have an equal partnership. I do take on more of the mental load in terms of finances, investments, doctors appointments, etc. but Liam acknowledges that and takes on more of the physical load. He insists that I do more, while I think he does.\n\nI\u2019m not saying either of us are perfect or that our relationship.

He said he didn\u2019t know if he wanted to be with me that he would let me know on what he decides. I begged and begged. He said I had hurt him for mentioning divorce, that it doesn\u2019t matter anymore, there was a 0.1% chance of us being together, that he\u2019s been going to church and wanted different values for himself, that he could even reinvent himself if we divorced.

I had dropped out of college to start a business. The business did miserably and I had already had issues stemming from the after effects of my abusive mother.\n\nI entered a cycle of drinking and self sabotage. Amy always wanted to become a Speech Language Pathologist and when we were dating I talked about my plan to make enough to put her through the required master's program by the time we were in our late twenties, so I felt like a failure for not being able to do that and distanced myself from her.\n\nI was left taking care of our daughters ( now 29F and 27F) while my wife dealt with debts incurred due to me personally guaranteeing business loans and using my credit cards to pay expenses at the end. \n\nI was drinking, went to rehab several times, and Amy resented me and constantly complained about her struggles finding a well paying job with a communications degree.\n\nI finally got a minimum wage job, hated it, and was so depressed that I took the money from my paycheck and put down a deposit on an apartment two states away.\n\nAmy divorced me, and I lost contact with the kids. That was when I hit rock bottom and woke up. I stopped this sick self fulfilling prophecy loop I was in. \n\nI got a degree, started another business. I am now married to my second wife \" Dina\" (26F) three years ago and we have a 2 year old son. \n\nHowever, even though me and my two other kids are in more constant communication talking with them brings up very unpleasant memories and I can feel the resentment. I told Dina that therapy with them felt counterproductive and she said since I apologized I had to just leave the ball in their court about whether they would accept or not, and if they don't see my sincerity then that's their issue.\n\nSo my relationship with them is at a civil point. I try to make it up by being the best dad to our son and working hard so he'll never have to struggle for money or opportunities in life.  Dina was fine with them coming to the wedding but it seemed strange to broach it.\n\nNow I'm getting an award by a professional organization and all honorees can get their guests in to the event for free, as long as you RSVP them. My two other kids know about this event, Amy apparently knows I have the opportunity of inviting them and allegedly encouraged them to ask. \n\nI got a text from one of them where they were hinting at being there to support me saying \" despite our differences, we are proud of you and hope we are able to celebrate important life events with you from now on.\" It took me a while to respond properly and I just accepted the congratulations and said I was grateful for the recognition. \n\nBut the next time I talked to one of them they were icy and seemed disappointed.

All has been well. Been talking for a couple weeks now. Only had one arguments. Thinks have been flowing nicely. Last night we were just chatting and she asked how i felt about my ex\u2019s. I simply said I\u2019m thankful for the memories but there are no feelings or anything involved with them. When i asked her back, i got a \u201che treated me so well, i can\u2019t say anything bad about him, he really treated me amazing\u201d. Okay\u2026i told her she hasn\u2019t answered the question yet. Her second answer was \u201ci don\u2019t know, what do you mean by feelings?\u201d In my mind i though this girl must be playing dumb since she asked me the same exact question. So i rephrased it, would you ever take him back? She said \u201cNo, ask me why\u201d. So i asked, she replied \u201cbecause he\u2019s in a different country\u201d. She also mentions he has a \u201cspecial place in her heart\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t even know what question to follow up with in that moment. I truly respect her honesty, but i just got turned off so quick, my stomach felt upside down. I told her i don\u2019t think she\u2019s over her ex yet and it\u2019s best we don\u2019t continue this. She tried to take back what she said but i heard what i heard. AITAH? I\u2019m truly a nice and forgiving person but it hurt.\n\nUpdate: Just want to thank all you guys for your replies. Every single one of you are amazing. It hurts because it\u2019s rare to find someone who i can click with these days like this girl. But hey, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll push through and keep doing my thing.

{"post": {"title": "AITAH for not inviting my mother to the funeral and getting angry when she came anyway?", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "I am a bit socially challenged, so I'm totally ready to get slaughtered in this sub, but here goes nothing...\n\nA little bit of context: My (32F) mother (60F) is and has always been very manipulative, overbearing and sometimes even hostile towards me. Let's just say that there is a lot of built up stuff, and I have been considering going no contact with her, but decided against it because that would have made my life even more difficult.\n\nMy parents are divorced. My dad is not in bad terms with my mother, but has moved on and doesn't necessarily want to stay in touch with her. My dad's sister, who was not in any way close with my mother, died some time ago. Where I live, deaths are announced in the local newspaper (\"so and so has passed away at this institution\"). After the initial announcement, it is customary to a) either have an open invitation to the funeral in the local newspaper, or b) invite people personally. My dad decided to invite only the immediate family, so no open invitation was posted.\n\nMy mom religiously reads the obituaries in the newspaper, and caught my aunt's passing. She sent me a text saying she was very sorry, and asked when the funeral was going to take place. I knew my dad didn't invite her for a reason (I discussed it with him because I knew something like this might happen), so I just thanked her and told her it would be \"on Saturday\". No reply.\n\nFriday rolls around, and she texts me whether I think it would be okay for her to come to the funeral. I replied that I can't really answer that question, and she should ask the organizer of the funeral (my dad). She replied with a very hostile \"ok\". \n\nFuneral was going to take place 2 PM, and on Saturday she texts me again at 10 AM, saying she hasn't received the time and the place for the funeral. I replied nothing, because at this point I was furious for her basically inviting herself and not getting the obvious hints that she is not wanted. She apparently managed to get the details from my dad, because when we (me and my partner) drove up to the chapel she was waiting there in her car. As soon as we got out of the car, she approached us, apparently thinking we would walk into the funeral together. I was livid so I just pretended that I was in a hurry to get in and started powerwalking towards the chapel. I didn't even gaze in her general direction at the service, and she left directly after. I haven't talked to her since (which is very untypical to her, because she loves to send inappropriate remarks on how nice I looked at a funeral).\n\nMy partner, who has also had a taste of her shitty personality, thinks I'm totally in the right for not catering to her and ignoring her at the funeral. But I'm thinking whether IATA and I've been behaving very cruelly in this situation. I know that in her mind she feel should have been invited to the funeral because she loved my aunt so dearly (not true at all).

{"post": {"title": "AITAH for apparently not letting my ex go to the birth of his daughter?", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "\nFor context me and my ex wasn\u2019t together for that long. But long enough. 3 years ago we first started talking we got a long really well, but we lost all contact nothing ended up going on. But that brings us to now. We got back in contact a couple months ago and then I found out he had a child on the way\n\nI wasn\u2019t too bothered because it\u2019s none of my businesses. We ended up meeting up quite frequently, and it was the most amazing experience I\u2019ve had! \n\n\nWe just bounced off each other. We was like the same person we danced we kissed we laughed we smiled we did everything night walks, looking at the stars all that cute stuff I\u2019ve never experienced before.\n\nHe reminded me he got a baby on the way and I said I know but doesn\u2019t change how I felt about him. His ex told him she didn\u2019t want him anything to do with the baby and she has someone else (new boy) to help raise her baby. And he was obviously hurt and I stuck by him. \n\nI ended up going on a family vacation and we talked and we FaceTimed every day and I become his girlfriend. Everything been the same loving and kind compliments the lot.\n\nAs of last week he randomly started ignoring me for a full 37 hours I was so confused to what was going on. And he was viewing my Snapchat stories opening my messages so I was confused? The next day I had texted him again and he broke up with me because \u201che couldn\u2019t be arsed\u201d so I was so confused where it had come from as I was so confused .\n\nI rang him and talked to him but he wouldn\u2019t tell me anything. Other than he was partying all day so I couldn\u2019t even get a message back? \n\n\nAnd now today I finally found out the reason. 2/3 days before he ignored me his daughter was born. I had no clue because he didn\u2019t tell me/talk to me about it. He blames me for not being able to be at the birth of his first daughter. \n\n\nFor contexts I forgot to add I\u2019m 18f and he\u2019s 20M . \n\nBut I responded back to that message which was random saying \u201chow the hell was I supposed to know your daughter was born, you exactly can not blame me, I had nothing to do with it and I\u2019ve never even spoke to her in my life\u201d \n\n\nNow he\u2019s saying it\u2019s my fault? In some sort of resentment towards me, I am hurt about it as we was so so close; I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019d describe it. But he was honestly amazing. We understood eachother but sometimes that\u2019s not always enough. \n\nHe responded to my message telling me to F off and I was nothing to do with him, me being me , I told him he needs to grow up and start taking accountability for his own actions and that he\u2019s a father now and need to step up. Because not going to lie he is on ketamine and cocaine. I know baddd. Nothing I can do about that tho. And since that conversation I can\u2019t help to wonder if I am the AH. \n\n\nAll in fairness we didn\u2019t speak of it much , but I made sure to let him know it wouldn\u2019t make me feel awkward if he wanted to talk about it. But I don\u2019t think I ever made him want to choose me or his daughter? For he knew in then 5 months or maybe longer before his child was born that his ex told him he was to have nothing to do with unborn child. \n\n\nIt\u2019s sad how quickly he turned against me and had to put all the blame on me so AITHA?\n\n\nEDIT: \n\n\nSo many of you are saying he was cheating on his baby mother with me. And that is in fact not true she had completely shut him out of her life and blocked him on every social media platform.\n\n\nAlso I\u2019ve never ever dreamed about touching a drug in my life. I\u2019ve seen what it could do to people, since then the last text message I have received of him was \u201cyou\u2019re nothing to be tho are you so Tara\u201d so now I\u2019ve completely just let him be.

{"post": {"title": "AITAH? EX-Girlfriend", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "When it comes to my friends and family, the question of AITAH is split down the middle pretty hard.\n\nI (27M) had a girlfriend (25 F) 12 months ago that I was madly in love with ( \\~3 years together). We often spoke about our future together, had our seperate lives, were in the healthiest relationship either of us had ever been in. Last September, I lost my job - 4 days later she broke up with me out of nowhere. Up to that point I had spent the last three years in a very lucrative sales role. I provided for both of us, went on vacations, paid for every meal, paid for all the weddings we attended together, anything and everything we did together I could afford and I loved to take care of her. Everything was reciprocal, she would get me gifts...thanked me for everything endlessley. Well after we broke up, i took about a week to reflect and decided to move out of state to a city I always knew I was intersted in. I was employed with in three weeks of moving, in what most would consider another extremely lucrative sales role. At the end of July, I closed the biggest deal in company history, which lead to praise on LinkedIn. It also inturn lead to a very large commision check (low 6 figures). The praise on LinkedIn made its rounds and it came across her feed. She texted me after not being in contact since x-mas day 2022. Started with, \" hey i saw the news on linkedin, congratulations...happy to see youre doing well.\" We exchanged a few more plesantries...seeing how eachother were doing. Then she hit me with a bomb...I miss you, i regret everything. Well at this point I had spent months in therapy trying to wrap my head around what had happened. I had come to the conclusion that she was not for me, considering she couldnt stand by me when things got tough. I was there through a few small mental health deteriorations on her part, her being let go, and many other things that couples are there for each other. \n\nWe continued to talk off and on...and about 3 days after the intial message she said she wanted to come see me. So we planned for about 4 weeks later, she would come and spend a 3 day weekend with me. I bought her plane ticket, and sent it over to her. We maintained connection through that time. Well the moment she asked to come this is when the plan started. I decided I would get her the plane ticket, but I would have a flight out of town the same day and about and hour after she would get to my city. I chose the same airline so we would be in the same terminal. When she landed, I was sitting at the gate, with my bag. She saw me and was obviously very surprised, but I had a carry on and backpack with me. She asked what they were, I pulled another small bag out of my backpack with the last few pieces of her belonging that were never given back (I didnt keep these things on purpose, it was things that were found during unpacking after the move, a sweatshirt, a pair or two of gym shorts, and one of her tops). I gave the bag to her, told her these were the last few of her belongings...and I would be taking the flight a few gates down and we were going to board in the next 30 minutes. She was obviously shocked...the look in her eyes was the same look in my eyes when she walked into my apartment and broke up with me out of nowhere. I had already purchased another flight for her, same day back to her city. She started getting very upset, \" i told xy and z, i was coming to see you what do you want me to tell them? this is is embarrasing, why would you do this.....i dont deserve this.\" Well her flight was 90 minutes later so quick turnaround...just a short lay over. I explained to her that I knew she reached out when she realized I had rebounded on my feet better than I was than when we were together. i knew she loved me for my money...and not for who I was.

{"post": {"title": "AITAH for hoping that my sister doesn't gets her kids back.", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "So I 24(F) have a sister who is a few years older than me. My sister got pregnant at the time of the pandemic. Everything was going well. I would babysit my baby niece while my sister was working  ,our mom would also help too. My sister will let us take my niece out to walks and play with her, but that change months after  she got pregnant with her second child. She would constantly be yelling and get mad at everything we understood because she was pregnant and we know how difficult pregnancy can. After having her second child she would be happy sometimes then the next minute she would start screaming at my mom for being a bad mother to her  even though my mom has helped her a lot. She had also called our mom  a \" pedophile\" for changing my nephew's diaper because she heard him crying. My sister would lock my niece and nephew in her room and wouldn't let us see them, we could hear them cry to go outside. She would also only changed their diapers when it was hella full.We tried telling my sister that to please get help because what she was doing wasn't right at all , but she refused. She had also posted on Facebook how she was looking for a man to marry and posted our freaking address. She got many replies from guys. We got very furious because something could of happened not only to us , but to her kids. She would constantly call immigration on both parents because 'they didn't belong here and should go back to where they came from\" her words not mine. Then one day she called these random guys ( I guess those guys are her friends) to go to our house and telling them to enter my parents room , but they mistook room and broke down my door. I got really scared and screamed my lungs out from what I heard is that they had weapon with them. She left with her kids so the police couldn't really do anything because we didn't knew where she was. Then a few months later she came back to the house with her kids and we welcome  her back again thinking she had change , but that wasn't the case. Then one day she got really out of control and started beating up our mom ( the only thing my mom said to her is that she was mopping wrong and that the floor was to wet and someone could slip easily and get injured) my mom try to defend , but my sister is stronger than my mom. My sister threw mom hard on to the floor which led her be unconscious for few minutes. We called both the police  and the paramedics stating that there was a physical fight and that my mom isn't waking up. They came and when they finally got my mom back we all begged her ( even the police)  to please have my sister taken , so when my mom finally agreed my sister was taken away leaving us to take care of her kids. We provide my niece and nephew with things they need and from time to time we spoil them. We also give them lots of loving attention and care. My niece sleeps in the same room with me and calls me mama. She is very attached to me and cries when I have to leave to work. I also love my nephew , but I kinda can't stand being around him for very long because he just hits , hits, and hits. My sister was in jail for almost a year and was told she isn't allowed to see her kids for a few years. We have grown very attached to them and we know once she has her kids back she will probably won't let us see them or let us see them very less. .

She couldn\u2019t pick me and my siblings up from school anymore so we had to get a babysitter to pick us up and stay with us. She also stopped volunteering in our classes/extracurriculars and driving on field trips because she got a part time job next to my sisters school to pay for her tuition (our dad wouldn\u2019t pay her tuition because he said the public school was fine).

After Jennifer\u2019s passing , Mark met me and we got married soon after . His family believe he moved on so fast because I took advantage of a vulnerable, grieving man and don\u2019t want to have anything to do with me .\nWe were supposed to go to my in laws for Canadian thanksgiving in October . I knew it would be difficult and awkward but I was looking forward to it . At breakfast time Mark told me that his family offered to fly Evan to be with them for thanksgiving. I said I don\u2019t understand?! Why would they do that ? I thought we are all going ? He said \u201coh ! I guess I misunderstood! They are not ready to meet you yet ! Don\u2019t worry about it \u201d. I asked if they are punishing me for my last night\u2019s post calling myself Evan\u2019s mom? He said he doesn\u2019t know. I admit I\u2019m pregnant and hormonal and over sensitive. I told Mark you should have stood up for me ? How are you okay with this ? Are they gonna disinvite our baby in future as well ? He said \u201ccalm down ! Just let it go for now \u201c .I told Mark I have to go to work early and cant drop off Evan at school. I went to my car and SOBBED . I\u2019m tired of being treated like I\u2019m a villain. I know they are grieving and it\u2019s hard but why are they punishing me ? I\u2019m raising their grand son why are they creating friction ! Wouldn\u2019t he ask why my dad and his wife are not invited ? Am I really being an asshole for expecting them to at least give me a chance ?\n\n**Update**:\n I texted Mark for my Facebook post . I apologized for crossing boundaries and disrespecting his family . I asked him to apologize to his family on my behalf since I\u2019m not in contact with them . I explained that I honestly just wanted Evan to know that he is loved by both of us and will be loved the same way as we will love his little sister . I never dreamed of replacing his mom or erasing his mom\u2019s memories. I also told Mark I\u2019m emotionally drained . I\u2019m staying at my parents for a while . He replied \u201c No ! Don\u2019t do this to Evan and I ! Come back home \u201c.. I\u2019m too exhausted to answer back\n\n**eta**: Evan had a soccer practice today . Mark decided to bring him to my parents to see me afterward even though I asked for space . My parents saw my annoyed face and told Evan that he should go for a walk with Nana and Papa ( my parents ) and tell them about his soccer game over an ice cream. My mom told me to go talk to him while everyone is out . I told him how I felt ! How I feel like I\u2019m a maid and a nanny so I do my job without even have a saying . He said that\u2019s not true and I\u2019m being hormonal. He explained that Jennifer\u2019s parents are living near his parents in Moncton . So it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to spend thanksgiving at his hometown anyways . They are not ready , his parents are not ready , they are still very much grieving and he Is just letting them . However , they have every right to see their grand son so he is gonna go with him. Evan gets to see all his families and grandparents. I asked him if he is disappointed that I got pregnant? He said of course not ! He apologized for not coming with me to appointments or barely acknowledging lately . Anyways, I told him that I only come back if he agrees to counselling. He sighed and said I don\u2019t believe in therapy but if this makes you back home !

It might also turn a temporary coolness towards you into a permanent resentment. \n\n(4) It would be wonderful if the extended family could just \u201cget over\u201d grieving, or somehow grow to a higher level of maturity in how they process their grief.

{"post": {"title": "Botched Proposal? AITAH?", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been dating my girlfriend for 7 years. We got together when I was 22 and I\u2019ve known only her as my partner for most of my adult life. I was unable to meet her parents for about 5 years due to cultural reasons which I am accepting of but that may have delayed my proposal. Anyway, this year, I proposed.\n\nI took her to a few places where we had some of our first dates and then at sunset, on a beach not too far from home, I asked her to marry me. I had a photographer there, and our closest friends were there to surprise her with flowers and champagne. I feel like everything came out great, her nails were done, she looked beautiful, and she was completely surprised. We then went to dinner and spent the weekend at a small cottage in a remote area next to the ocean, we went kayaking and spent quality time with close friends. Our friends even decorated our room for us with rose petals and balloons, etc. \n\nI had an extended period of time scheduled off from work, and I was able to extend a trip to Hawaii for a week into a 10 day trip shortly after our engagement (2-3 days). I thought about proposing in Hawaii but she made a request to me that her friends be there when she gets proposed to and I\u2019m not in a financial position to take her friends to Hawaii and I knew it would be unfair for me to ask them to be there because it is an expensive trip. We also travel together with friends often and I wanted to have some quality time alone with her. The trip went amazingly and I couldn\u2019t be happier with my engagement.\n\nUnfortunately, the same can not be said for my Fianc\u00e9e. She said yes to marrying me, but she tells me that \"I knew what she wanted\" and it had to be a \"grand gesture.\" Her requests prior to my proposal were a hot air balloon proposal, and she also tells me she wanted to be proposed to in Hawaii. I looked for hot air balloon experiences in Hawaii but there are none due to trade winds. She also made comments such as being proposed to in France. I think her issue is that at the very moment of me asking, it was just on a beach at sunset, and maybe that wasn't enough. \n\nI am struggling to come to grips with this. It's debilitating because the moment is gone and can never be changed. I felt a lot of anxiousness about proposing and the weekend trip we took with friends was expensive combined with the trip to Hawaii to boot. I really felt deeply that those places I took her when we had our first dates were meaningful to me. I think also my anxiety came from knowing I was going to mess it up somehow. It was hard for me to even keep her attention while I was trying to ask the question. Our trips come maybe twice a year. I've never been to Hawaii in my life, but I wanted to do this because it's our engagement.\n\nI guess I should've just proposed in Hawaii. She's upset and I can't fix this. I don't want to feel like garbage about the way I proposed, and I'm actually proud of myself for doing it.

{"post": {"title": "AITA? I want my partner (20NB) to leave me (18F)", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "\nWhat would you do? Backstory: this is my first ever proper relationship. My (20 nonbinary) partner and I (18F) met on a dating app, and within a couple of days, they drove to come, pick me up and take me back to their place to hang out for the weekend. Everything was great, and I had a lot of fun. We did the same thing the next weekend, but on the first night of me being there, they told me that they had feelings for me. I told them that I had feelings for them to, because I felt bad and didn\u2019t want them to be upset that I didn\u2019t. We had only know each other for a week but facetimed all day every day.  I have since developed feelings for them, and I do love them but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in love with them.\n\n Long story short, after less than a month of dating they ended up getting kicked out of the house they were in by their roommate and had nowhere else to go so they moved in with me. The original plan was that they would stay with me in my house, with my parents until they got a job and got back on their feet. They now have a job, and I\u2019ve suggested to them moving out, or at the very least getting some friends because I\u2019m the only person they ever hang out with and it\u2019s all become a bit too suffocating for me. I\u2019m with them 24/7, and when I\u2019m not with them I\u2019m at work. I don\u2019t do anything else, and the very few times I have gone out with friends, I am always receiving calls and messages from them. They always asked me what time I\u2019m going to be home, who I\u2019m with, and what we\u2019re doing and I would be totally fine with that but if any of it changes they get upset. I once said I\u2019d be home around 10:30 and when I texted them (well in advance) that I would be a bit later they got upset and told me to ask my friends to take me home, or they would come get me and it ruined the night. Now my friends don\u2019t want to hang out with me.\n\n I suggested to them today that they move out to make our relationship better because I feel suffocated and I don\u2019t want to have to break up with them, they basically refused and said they don\u2019t see how it could fix anything and that rentals are too expensive and so I just asked if they could get friends instead so I\u2019m not the only person they talk to and they started sobbing and crying and asking if I was going to leave them. I said I wasn\u2019t, but now I think I want to. I just feel very suffocated but I don\u2019t really know what to do because this is my first relationship, I\u2019m young and I don\u2019t want to hurt their feelings. I also don\u2019t want to break up with them and still have to live with them while they find somewhere to live. My friends don\u2019t like them, my coworkers said all what they\u2019re doing is called gaslighting and my parents don\u2019t like them. I need help. What should I do?

This forced them to sell their big house and downsize to a condo, which was ultimately better since they used their profit to pay a majority of the smaller house. My BIL (37M) never worked until MIL forced him to help at the deli because she couldn\u2019t afford to pay other workers, meaning he did not get paid. Once the deli was sold, I helped him create a resume and referred him to a job where he now makes 20/hour. Fast forward to 4 years later, he meets  a girl (35F) and they marry within a year in court because they\u2019re \u201cold\u201d and want to settle down. \n\nOk, so after their court wedding they announced they would have their reception next spring in Mexico since that is where his wife is from.

I explain that it doesn\u2019t mean we would pay for their some of their wedding expenses. I pointed out that his wife\u2019s parents are already contributing 10k to the wedding, and that if they haven\u2019t been able to save up to cover the additional costs then maybe they need to scale things back.

Sarah asked to do this for us as a kind gesture during our grief and as she's dog-sat for us before we didn't think much of it and obliged and she looked very happy.\n\nOn the day out our trip we brought the 4 dogs to her house with ready prepared meals, toys they like etc like the essentials and she was very happy to take them off our hands and let us go on our trip. During the trip we heard none of her and didn't see any pics of the dogs when we called to see if everything's alright she said that it was and she didn't want to bother us during the days leading up to the funeral which was a bit weird in hindsight.\n\nThe day we came back she greeted us with a huge smile and with our dogs that looked exhausted the 3 big dogs had no energy and most of their meals hadn't been eaten and the small dog (the super-mutt who's almost18) looked deathly we rushed all 4 to the nearest veterinary ER and were told they hadn't eaten and were severely dehydrated. We of course exploded on Sarah on the phone about this we kept questioning her on how this could've happened and how if she couldn't handle them why ask to take them in, we were horrified. We gave her more than enough food for them for the 1 week we were gone and told her about how important it is for them to drink enough water especially with the current heat in our country.\n\nMy brothers agree with my outburst but I feel bad looking back on it, so AITAH?  \n\n\nedit: I was told by multiple commenters that i should've added what Sarahs response was so here's what she had told us and some actions we will be taking.

We have two kids (6yo girl and 5yo boy).\nWe are talking about me being a stay at home mom for almost 7 years, him being a narcissist (or at least having all the traits of one) and functional alcoholic. We have been together for almost 9 years and alcohol abuse has been a problem since his teenage years, but his parents only let it out after we were married.\n\nHis alcohol abuse got unbearable (with physical, mental and verbal abuse) the last 18 months but seeking help has never been an option because he thinks alcoholics are people that lose their job, get to work late, aren\u2019t successful and so on\u2026\n\nI found out his affair not long ago.\nThe person he had an affair with was a common friend who used to hang out in our home and knows our kids. There were promises of a new family, kids, marriage\u2026I was sick to my stomach reading all of that.\nAfter finding this I found out that I have been basically cheated on emotionally and physically the entire time with multiple women.\n\nEven after finding out I kept trying \u201cfor the family\u201d to later found out he kept lying to both of us. Since then I have been through all stages of grief. The relentless caller to cry and say \u201chow could you do this to our family\u201d to the \u201clet\u2019s be friends for the sake of the kids\u201d\n\nAfter realizing he was not interested in anything but draining my mental health, I decided to go low/no contact.\nHe claimed to be making all these advances in life. Therapy, no alcohol and even going to church for the new girlfriend.\nI was so sad/mad/jealous, you name it.\nHow could he do this for other people and wasn\u2019t able to do for us?! It was heartbreaking.\nI lost 40 pounds in less than 2 months.\nIt took a long time to start healing and even though I am better, I am nowhere near fully healed.\n\nOne day he came to drop the kids off after his weekend and forgot to take my son\u2019s lovey bunny from his car.\nThe kids are going through a lot. Making him unnecessarily sleep without his lovey wasnt something that seemed emotionally reasonable at that time, even if he slept in my bed and snuggled all night.\nI begged him to bring it back. He said no that the only way he would drive \u201call the way\u201d (13 min away) was when his game would be over 4.5 hours later my request.\nThe game hadn\u2019t even started.\nI asked him to come drop off the bunny before he went to his game since my house was on the way and he said if I wanted before the game I\u2019d have to go pick up in the parking lot when he\u2019d be arriving.\n\n\nI explained to him I had both kids and that was bed time, that strapping them both in car seats, take them out, carry them upstairs would be a lot of unnecessary work. He didn\u2019t budge and said \u201cask me if I care\u201d\n\nHe told me \u201cI will let you know when I leave my house\u201d and something in me told me to just go way before that and check the bar he goes. I sat there and watched him drinking for almost 30 min. He was there the whole time.\nNot just the lie of the alcohol consumption which isn\u2019t my business directly, but to put this above taking his son\u2019s who\u2019s going to a hard moment lovey.\n\nHe has cut me off of our finances. He pays all the bills and leaves some money that barely covers food and gas.\nI gave up my career for him. I stayed on his side through his cancer. He made 30k the first year we were together and is going to make 200k this year.\n\nNow he gets to take the kids only a couple of hours a week and every other weekend and literally do every single fun stuff money can buy even though the kids mention he doesn\u2019t really participate and only watches. All the things I love to do with them and he complained it was boring and a waste of our money when he was part of the family. \n\nLast week he took the kids to \u201ca vacation\u201d and I got slammed with the divorce papers that asked for full custody, disproportional share of the assets and so on. A temporary order for me to leave the family home even though he has been living in his own apartment for 4 months.\n\nKids comes back from vacation and mentioned he drank all the time, that they didn\u2019t use car seats and on top of that they lost weight. My kids are tiny, two pounds is A LOT for them.\n\nI was fed up. So done. He might have changed for her but for us he\u2019s the same abusive liar.\nI waited and since some of his coworkers know the situation, they tipped him off to me.\nI sat outside a bar and saw him drinking for FIVE HOURS. No water. No Food.\nGuys, he was DRUNK.\nI called 911, I watched him get pulled over. He pulls his badge and he let him go.\nJust like that. I sobbed. I thought he would be so alerto had blown my chance.\nHe left the spot where he got pulled over straight to another bar where he stayed for 40 min drinking another beer. \n\nNow I think it will happen again and it\u2019s my only chance to fight this influencing person for the custody of my kids. I don\u2019t even have money for a lawyer and they will shred me to pieces if I get there just with messages and proof of the affair. He doesn\u2019t even get the kids the days he\u2019s supposed to but is asking full custody.\n\nAITH for waiting until someone tips him off to me again to call the cops and hopefully a non corrupted one stops him next time to get the DWI?

Explain the situation and your intentions. Listen to their concerns and try to find a mutually acceptable solution. This could involve compensation for the loss of space or other accommodations.\n\nConsider Alternatives: If claiming the additional width would have a significant negative impact on your neighbor's renter or could lead to conflicts with other neighbors, explore alternative solutions. For example, you could explore ways to use your existing property more efficiently or find other ways to address your space needs.\n\nCommunity Impact: Consider the broader impact on your neighborhood.

She's a beautiful blonde, with a sexy french accent, and I was delighted to connect with her and feel stronger feelings day after day. I felt something incredible with her and we could text and talk for hours. We went on a tonne of dates, and I wine and dined her because I initially saw her as someone who I wanted to know better, who might be my special person. We went on hikes, and dinners, and the spa together, and It seemed perfect. I helped her prepare for her driving test, and we had sleepovers, and I loved it.

But I was shocked to realize this girl has a half a million dollars saved up by 23. At first i thought she might just come from a rich family. Maybe it wasn't sus, and she was related to some oligarch family or something. After talking more, she revealed some info about her parents. They weren't poor, but they definitely weren't rich on that kind of scale. I knew then in my gut that something was wrong. I am pretty good at finding information when motivated to do so. And soon, I searched, and soon I found it. She had an OF, and a PH account. My heart broke. I needed to understand. How? Why? How could she do this? How could she not know what it would mean?

We have two living children and have tried for years to have another baby. We live away from our home state (important for later) Last year I got pregnant and I told a few trusted friends and family right away, and specifically instructed them not to tell anyone because I have a history of loosing pregnancies and I don't want to have to go through the process of saying oh nvm if I were to loose the baby. Well one of the family members decided to go against my wishes and every few days would say \"oh I told this person\" and \"oh I told that person\" after the second time they did this I specifically said to not tell anyone else and they agreed, but continued telling people and then telling me they told people. I couldn't really get a hold of things because as stated before I live in a different state but my other family members had my back and would speak up and say that I didn't want the world knowing or ask if I was ok with the family member telling other people. Well it was getting close to a holiday and so many people had found out from that family member that it forced me and my husband to announce the pregnancy at least 10 weeks earlier than intended because we wanted to do it our way AND we wanted people to find out from us not someone else.  Well days after announcing I ended up loosing the baby. We were devastated and having to retract our pregnancy announcement hurt so badly. But the family member never apologized. \nFlash forward a year and a half I am now pregnant again, aside from me and my husband only 4 other people know, 5 if you count someone whom I have a professional relationship with (its necessary this person know because it affects the work I put in).  I am struggling because I am close to the person who gossiped and want to tell the person the news because this baby is in their direct lineage, but my husband and I think it is best that we wait on telling anyone else until I am well in to my second trimester (I am 5 weeks atm). I feel really good about this pregnancy, of course I am terrified about loosing it but I don't feel an impending doom like I did last time. I have considered cutting the person off because they inflicted so much child hood trauma and caused so much stress in my other pregnancies but they are the closest thing I have to a parent (one of my parents left when I was a baby the other died after I had my second child), they helped raise me, and I talk to them everyday so we are close, which makes it hard not to accidentally spill the beans.

{"post": {"title": "Am I the asshole for being fed up with my boyfriend's stinginess?", "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "So, here's the deal. I've been dealing with a series of frustrating situations in my relationship, but the biggest issue is my boyfriend's extreme stinginess.\n\nA few months ago, I posted on Reddit about my partner not having a job and not helping with household tasks (while I studied, worked, and made the house chores). Things have improved slightly since then, but his level of help is still lacking. The real problem is that he's become incredibly tight-fisted since getting a job.\n\nI'm not someone who spends recklessly; in fact, I'm quite organized with my finances. I budget and keep a list of expenses to manage my personal finances efficiently. The issue is that every time he buys something for the house, like groceries, he constantly monitors what I consume. If we make pasta, he watches how much cheese I use and scolds me if he thinks it's too much, and so...\n\nI cover the rent for our house, and our arrangement was that he would handle all the utilities and taxes. He's been working for three months now, and I haven't received anything from him for the utilities as we agreed, and so, I'm paying for the house rent, taxes, utilities and I'm now eating in my mother's house so that I don't \"waste\" food. I earn waaaay less than he does, and with this situation my savings are almost null, while his are significant.\n\nHis parents have always been penny-pinching, and I initially tried to understand, thinking he might be adjusting to working again or that it's how he was raised. But I'm at my wit's end, I feel economically used (even if he earns now more than I do) and no matter how I communicate my feelings, nothing changes. He even gets offended when I tell him he's too stingy. I'm currently thinking of breaking up, and just getting another job to maintain myself and save some money.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for feeling this way?\n\nEdit: thanks to every single person who left a kind comment on this post \u2764\ufe0f I realized that this is not stinginess but economical abuse.

One night my ex and I were drinking and he started to pick a fight with me. I decided to leave and as I was grabbing my things he started punching me repeatedly. He was eventually pulled away from a neighbor that heard me screaming. I ended up losing a tooth and having a root canal on another tooth.  \nI ended up staying with him despite our relationship taking a turn for the worst. He would blame me for his abuse on my depression, degrade me, and manipulate my best friend. He would make me look like the bad guy by her telling her \"why aren't you with her and her friends. if you were her best friend why didn't she include you?\" (my friends came to support me while I was grieving).  \nMy best friend loved us being together and was always rooting for us. She always carried herself well and knew how to remain neutral in tough situations. I respected her and valued her opinions. She was sad when I wanted to break things off and asked to try and work on our relationship. The verbal abuse got worse and I ended up breaking up with him through text (this was in 2019). They both thought it was a dick move.  \nShe asked if it was okay to be friends with him and I told her I was okay with it, but when I saw stories on IG I realized I wasn't okay with it. I told her I didn't like it her response was \"well you said it was ok!\" They stayed distant friends talking here and there throughout the years.  \nFast forward to last week, she took him out to dinner as a \"thank you\" because he installed A/C at a low cost. I expressed how hurt it made me feel and that I didn't want an apology, I just wanted her to hear my take. She was defensive saying things like \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" \"So I'm a shitty friend not only to you, but to him too\" and \"since you're so stuck on that, I wanted to take them to dinner as a thank you for fixing my ac.\"  \nNGL, I was disappointed by her response because she usually handles things with grace.

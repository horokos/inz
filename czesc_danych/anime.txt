It's been a hell of a ride, filled with both tragic moments and hopeful resolutions, but as Anos-sama showed, he will not allow for injustice and tragedy to exist in the precious world that his goddess friend Militia made, as we take a deep dive into this episode.\n\nAvos-sama is very smug from taking Venuzdonoa, as she proclaimed that she has stolen everything from him. I can imagine him being annoyed that she is even stealing his lines.\n\n&gt;**Anos**: Stealing my title, subordinates, castle and sword is one thing... but stealing my catchphrase? You have gone to far, Avos Dilhevia... And it is time to remind you, who the true Demon King is...\n\nIt is cool to see a Demon King battle, as we get to see some of Anos' signature spells being used against him. It's sort like when you and your friend pick the same character in a fighting game against each other.\n\nFun fact about the red/black lightning spell. It is one of Anos' origin magic spells, called Jirasd. As we've established in S1, origin magic borrows power from an older and stronger existence. The older an existence is, the greater power it has. However, the older it is, the more uncertain its existence becomes, which makes its power difficult to control. Thus, the best way to use origin magic is to clearly know the existence of which one is borrowing power from or from an object with which they have an affinity. By its very nature of borrowing power from the origin, [origin magic cannot affect the origin itself.](https://i.imgur.com/asYZw2d.png) But how is Avos using it against Anos? Simple... While she is using the same spell, she is using herself as a origin for her spell, due to being an ancient entity with 2000 years of existence. It is also funny how Leorg (the guy who jumped Anos in S1) used Jirasd against Anos attempted to do so by invoking the origin of the male Demon King of Tyranny Avos Dilhevia. Since he defaulted the origin to who he thought was the Demon King, Jirasd was ineffective against Anos. Had he invoked a female Great Spirit Avos Dilhevia, then his Jirasd would have worked against Anos.\n\nSo how did Anos-sama overcome the Venuzdonoa-wielding Avos-sama? With a handy abilitiy he has called the [Mauve Magic Eyes](https://i.imgur.com/cBwwPoD.png), or as I affectionatelly call them the **Magic Eyes of Purple Destruction**. You know how Anos' Magic Eyes of Destruction destroy magic they gaze at? Well, the Mauve Magic Eyes destroy order or rather the divine powers of the gods. By using it, Anos was able to suppress the divine power inside of Venuzdonoa and prevent it from working properly before [stabbing Avos](https://i.imgur.com/ykUmDGg.png) [in the tit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm_KYPXPtWo).\n\nAvos-sama was weakened in her previous battle with Lay, due to being killed by the holy sword Evansmana, which is the Demon King's weakness and she couldn't recover in time for her battle with Anos. Heck, even Anos in S1 didn't immediately recover after he resurrected after Lay accidentally killed him, as he needed the Fan Union to replenish his magic power. Nevertheless, Avos-sama's weakness is a bit obvious to see... As the embodiment of the legends of the Demon King of Tyranny, she is as powerful as the people of the world believe the Demon King is. Even with the exaggeration of the rumors, Anos has yet to fully demonstrate the abyss of his true power, as it is likely that only he knows how powerful he is. Lay might have some inclination having battled him for a long time, but even he can also only speculate. So /u/JzanderN was right: *\"you could overestimate Anos and you would still be underestimating him.\"*\n\nAnd so Nosgalia reveals his true evil plan. The Child of God Avos Dilhevia was created not to try to defeat Anos, but to usurp his castle and sword, so she would use her massive magic power to awaken Abernyu, the Goddess of Destruction. And what will happen when the Goddess of Destruction is revived? All of the destruction that should have happened by was supressed by her sealing with rush out in backlash \u2014 like a river breaking through a dam.\n\nAfter seeing Nosgalia's smugness and arrogance this entire season, it is nice to see him get his just desserts... But what happened there? Well, we know from EP9 that Erdomaid was working on a spell to usurp Nosgalia's divine power but that spell was still incomplete, although he made decent progress in its creation. And presenting the incomplete spell to the Demon King of Tyranny, they would be able to easily complete it. While it initially seemed that he would use Avos for that, he essentially rigged the scenario that he wins either way.\n\nAnd now comes the tearful reunion, as Leno faded due to the power of the Love Fairy reaching its limit, giving her just enough time to say goodbye to her family. But all is not lost, as Anos works to save the also perishing Misa from dying due to having only half a source. So how did Anos pull it off? Remember, spirits **do not reincarnate**, unlike demons an humans.\n\n* We know from Leno that a spirit is most influence by the lore they are born from. Due to being born from the lore of the Demon King of Tyranny, Avos Dilhevia is doomed to be evil by her nature. If Anos had ordered Igareth to spread a rumor that Avos was a benevolent spirit, it would only cause Misa harm. And even if it didn't, the original Demon King Avos lore is too widespread to be changed in any way. However, there is a catch... While the past lore of the Demon King of Tyranny cannot be changed, no one said anything about the future lore, which is yet to be written. The lore of the Demon King explicitly mentions the Demon King's reincarnation, which is the most famous legend. So even though spirits do not reincarnate, the lore would mean that reincarnation is a possibility. However, it is unknown if a spirit, that originally is incapable of reincarnation, would merely survive of the lore that states she can. Which brings us too:\n* The Teardrop Flower. The flowers that are used to give birth to spirits after receiving Leno's tears. The flower that was used had a heck of a story, [blooming during Leno's death](https://maou-gakuin.fandom.com/wiki/File:Reno_blooms_a_Teardrop_Flower.gif), [being picked up by Lena](https://maou-gakuin.fandom.com/wiki/File:Lena_finding_a_grave.jpg), and carried all the way here. By using this flower, and the new lore, it allowed for the birth of a new-yet-familiar spirit, known as the **Great Spirit Misa**. While the two halves of Misa's source were destroyed (by the Sun of Destruction and Lay), due to the new lore that mentions Avos' reincarnation as a benevolent pure spirit, means that Misa was born again as a pure Great Spirit this time. And that has the added benefit of reviving Leno, as the fact that she contradicted her lore no longer exists due to Misa being a pure spirit now.\n* But you might be wondering, if Misa still has her Avos powers? The answer is yes! As we see with Lay, a perfect reincarnation changes the form but not the substance of a person, as Lay is simply Hero Kanon as a demon. Similary, despite Misa changing races, her new lore stated nothing about her powers being altered and merely stated that Avos Dilhevia was reborn due to Evansmana's blessings as a good spirit that was free of her evil. While the ceremony showed her in her transient form, she can still become Avos when she enters her true form. So goth Misa fans rejoice, you still get your dommy mommy to stick around. But Misa in Avos' clothes was weirdly adorable :)\n\nAnd so the time has come for the world to acknowledge Anos as the true Demon King, as the Reordination Ceremony is also used to spread the lore of Misa to ensure that her existence remains. After 2000 years, Anos and Kanon/Lay's desire for peace is accomplished, while Misa's dream of a Dilhade that is united is also fulfilled, as she finally reunites with her family. It's a shame that [Militia](https://maou-gakuin.fandom.com/wiki/File:Militia_after-credits.png) didn't pop up to join the celebration so we could have the full quartet from 2000 years ago celebrate, but I guess she wasn't able to come visit. Though if the gods have attempted to imprison or seal Anos' goddess friend, then Anos will make what happened to Nosgalia seem like a fond memory. Cause remember, the humans \"killed\" Kanon when he didn't want to get onboard with their demon genocide plans.

I think the humor is top notch and both Vamirio's and Anne's straight man routine works fantastically. She's both funny and endearing.\n\nFor truly underwatched shows, though, you have to look no further than Synduality Noir - the main girl barely made it into the contest only to be doomed in round one, and I don't even think she's the best girl in the show. It's not an exceptional show, but mech mercenaries in a post-apocalyptic world is a pretty entertaining watch.\n\nI get why Reign of the Seven Spellblades wasn't as popular as it was (although it was decently popular), but I still feel it was slightly underwatched. It's Harry Potter with swords, but it also has its very own spin on the characters. Especially Oliver's backstory is super captivating and worth waiting a few episodes until it drops. And Nanao just has this attitude of taking every scene she's in. \\[Reign of the Seven Spellblades\\]&gt;!By the way, why is Peter (Petra?) not in this contest?!&lt;\n\nAnd lastly, Dark Gathering is already one of the best horror animes I've watched (just by virtue of making its horror actually scary despite being anime). The characters are also really fun, and I think the humor really works the way they've done it. Two of the main trio are also university students, so young adults for a change. Horror Pokemon has been a main stay in the Anime Corner top ten for a reason. Even if horror is not your favourite genre, as long as you can appreciate it I think Dark Gathering will be a great watch for you.", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "Urgnu-the-Gnu", "replies": []}]}

Nooo...](https://i.imgur.com/0U9EjpZ.png)\n\nBut seriously, I voted against almost every Kaguya-sama OP, and said it back then that I much preferred the ED. What I didn't realise at the time, was that they really are some of my favourites.\n\nThe Top 5 is more or less set I did struggle to fit order my A-Tier, honestly Sayuri's song is is more powerful and so are the lyrics. But somehow,  Secret Base still hit me harder. I kept wondering why, and eventually came with two reasons. First of all, I seem to remember Secret Base was used to great effect in the anime during emotional scenes. And lyrically, I felt very nostalgic, very relatable, it makes me think of childhood episodes, first crush, goodbyes when I moved school (I moved countries frequently). So yeah, it's personal. Now I know, that had sod all to do with the ED, but I am basically picking what I like feeling wise, rather than try to be an impartial judge of the technical quality.\n\nThe rest mostly get dumped into B-Tier. I like them enough to watch them to the end but nothing more. Controversially, I am not as fond of Sugar Song to Bitter Step. I put it down to the musical preference and lack of investment in the show. I suspect that it would probably go to B if I do watch the show, but the music would probably stop me from putting it any higher. Likewise, Lost in Paradise is quite a favourite for many, and while I appreciate the animation, it's not my choice of song. Another thing.. I don't personally think it really FIT JJK all that much TBH.\n\nFly Me To The Moon is a bit divisive, so I don't think it is such controversy that I put it that low. Truth to be said, I didn't like it back when I first watched Evangelion. And I probably wanted to like it because at the time, I probably wanted to like everything about Evangelion. I was more susceptible to hype back then. Again not really my musical taste. Fukashigi no Carte has a bit more potential to get moved up a tier if I watch the show, but right now, I can't place it any higher either (neither the music nor visual moves me - I am not adverse to slower emotional songs, but this one doesn't do it for me either).", "ups": 2, "depth": 1, "author": "xTooNice", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "Thanks for yet another tierlist.

Sentimental Crisis has something there with it visuals, but its song REALLY doesn't match with Kaguya's tone at all and I find it boring, and similarly the visuals are way too overly-dramatic-and-soap-opery, and it feels like they are depicting the same thing that they usually parody)\n* [Kigeki](https://v.animethemes.moe/SpyXFamily-ED1-NCBD1080.webm) vs **[Akuma no Ko](https://v.animethemes.moe/ShingekiNoKyojinS4Part2-ED1.webm)** (Two of the strongest EDs remaining in this bracket, shame they had to go against each other. I think I slightly give the edge to Kigeki visuals-wise, but I personally find Kigeki's song really boring and while Akuma no Ko isn't the most ground-breaking or amazing song to me, it's pretty good execution-wise and is one of the stronger songs in the bracket, and it has some nice visual shots as well)\n* **[My Nonfiction](https://v.animethemes.moe/KaguyaSamaWaKokurasetaiS3-ED2-NCBD1080.webm)** vs [Shunkan Sentimental](https://v.animethemes.moe/FullmetalAlchemistBrotherhood-ED4.webm) (They're kinda polar opposites; My Nonfiction has unconventional visuals, an unconventional concept, and an unconventional song, whereas Shunkan Sentimental feels like every other shounen OP/ED you've ever heard. Shunkan Sentimental's song is good, but the visuals are entirely forgettable, and so I give more credit to My Nonfiction's creativity and boldness, even if I again don't care about character animation.)\n* [Fukashigi no Carte](https://v.animethemes.moe/Aobuta-ED2-NCBD1080.webm) vs **[Torches](https://v.animethemes.moe/VinlandSaga-ED1-NCBD1080.webm)** (I hate to be one of the BGS 'haters' in this contest because I know a vocal minority of the core r/anime base despises BGS and I think the show is above-average, but I don't have good things to say about either its OP or ED. The ED is really sleep-inducing to me in terms of song and visuals. Torches feels more cinematic and atmospheric in both its visuals and song, and it matches the tone of Vinland Saga well.)\n\n---\n\n6/8 of my votes yesterday lost (2/8 won), big oof.

Of those, I would say that Chiisana Bokensha and Avid losing was mostly expected and I won't shed any tears for Stay Alive getting eliminated. Kibun Joujou just had to pick the one time I intentionally voted for it to get eliminated. While it isn't a fav, Fly Me To the Moon has definitely outstayed my welcome.. yet frustrating looks like it has the numbers to win the right side of the bracket. The biggest travesty though is Heart wa Oteage (my 2nd fav) getting eliminated by STYX HELIX.\n\nToday's vote:\n\n**Chikatto Chika Chika** vs Sentimental Crisis: I hate this match up, but for me Chikatto Chika &gt;= Heart wa Oteage &gt; Sentimental Crisis. I can understand why some people may not like to just see a single character dancing, and while Sentimental Crisis provide more of almost everything else, and is exceptional high quality, I just think that Chikatto Chika Chika's quality through the choreography and timing is just out of the world. I've probably re-watched this ED more than any other (Kumoko's is probably the runner up for the high energy song and spoiler-ish yet so accurate lyrics).\n\nKigeki vs **Akuma no Ko**: I'll be honest, both of them are Best 16 rather than Best 8 for me. I do prefer the song in Akuma no Ko and I like that night/in day/out transition occurring perfectly when the song picks up. u/Cryzzalis did make a good case for Kigeki, and to me they are fairly close (they are both B rank for me)\n\n**My Nonfiction** vs Shunkan Sentimental: I rather like Shunkan Sentimental (I did think of placing it as low A, but I think I am more comfortable with high B - I like the song, and visually I think it gets the job done, but I won't say it is super memorable; the other remaining FMA ED is better I think)\n\nFukashigi no Carte vs **Torches**: Torches get another win by default (the last time was Requiem of Silence). I mean, I'd rather have Fukashigi no Carte to Requiem of Silence, but without more investment in the show, I just can't vote for Fukashigi no Carte. I can appreciate OP/ED with multiple variations, but I think that needs to enjoy the base material. For example the OP of Gakkou Gurashi (which deserved to do get much further than it did) not only had those variations, but it had a catchy and fun song some great word plays, and was visually engaging. Even if I hadn't watched the show, I could enjoy that OP to some level. Fukashigi no Carte unfortunately doesn't even have a song I enjoy so that's that.\n\nDiscussion Prompt: As implied by post, I think it would have to go for Chikatto Chika Chika and Heart wa Oteage. Chikatto Chika Chika doesn't quantitatively have much going on in the screen. But Chika's movement and the choreography is just a joy to watch, and while it doesn't use many props, it uses them well. It's realistic and detailed enough to be mimicable (which is likely why it went viral). While Chika dance went with focus, Heart wa Oteage went with variation, and does it really well too.

But I think the lyrical composition (which will be a theme among the top 3 EDs today) is too good in Chikatto Chika Chika along with the animation quality (look at that clothing) and how well the song, the unique choreography and the vocal performance of Kohara Konomi captures Chika's character.\n* ~~Akuma no Ko~~ vs **Kigeki** \\- I think Akuma no Ko is decent, but lacks a sense of cohesion thematically, somewhat floundering and not knowing what it wants to do. I also think the song is just fine and it's aesthetically just decent, which is some serious steps behind Kigeki. Kigeki meanwhile is a beautiful lyrical story exploring Anya's backstory, talking about the warmth of familial bonds that she's forgotten, but regained with her encounter of Loid and Yor. It has beautiful aesthetic ideas and uses them for storytelling through the vehicle of era specific interior design or art. It's also a wonderful vocal performance by Hoshino Gen which along with the instrumental creates a phenomenally atmospheric entry to capture the beauty of SpyFam. As mentioned yesterday, I have a longer write-up from last year's reddit anime awards that is a bit dated in regards to my understanding of the ED, but covers the ED and it's incredible attention to detail at great length. I'll link it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdb2_qrE2BYr5EFEWM2_2xvBQRPKhugLK1x_qvpRHc/edit?usp=sharing) along with a recommendation to read it if you're interested in a longer breakdown. Kigeki is the best ED remaining in the contest by far, so it's worth it.\n* ~~Shunkan Sentimental~~ vs **My Nonfiction** \\- Shunkan Sentimental has a nice action sequence and a decent song and that's pretty much it. My Nonfiction on the other hand has wonderful animation, really nice character dynamics on display (particularly between Chika and Miyuki as well as Ishigami and Iino.), a fantastic progression of character development for Miyuki and ties so damn well into the episode at hand. But most importantly, it has incredible lyrical composition that is super effective in relation to Miyuki's character. Easy vote here.\n* **Torches** vs ~~Fukashigi no Carte~~ \\- Torches is very flawed, but the water animation of the 20 seconds is incredible and the progression from Thors and Iceland to Thorfinn and Vinland is handled exceptionally. Aside from that I'm not a big fan, but it's better than an ED that is two-thirds a walk cycle or a shot of water reciding and flowing back in on a beach. The last third even has large parts walk cycle with the only real potentially interesting parts being the quick camera shots and the ending of meeting up with a person. Even then, those parts are mostly poor or mediocre at best aside from the Futaba verison which actually does some meaningful things. But one of your ED's six versions being not god awful isn't a good track record.\n\n**Top 3 EDs of the day.**\n\n1. Kigeki\n2. My Nonfiction\n3. Chikatto Chika Chika\n\n**Discussion Prompt**\n\nAs someone who weighs visuals heavily I've gone on and on about this so I won't post my lengthy list yet another time, so instead I shall post my #1 pick only which is [Wareta Ringo](https://v.animethemes.moe/ShinsekaiYori-ED1.webm).\n\n**Reactions to yesterday's results**\n\nLost in Paradise dominating Chiisana Boukensha, both warranted and expected.\n\nNAH, You people did not just vote out the incredible cinematic and referential experience that is Heart wa Oteage for fucking STYX HELIX. I am convinced that 90% of the people who voted this way hasn't even watched the EDs at this point. You're fucking clowns.\n\nNandemonaiya getting kinda close to losing, sadly being close is not enough, but it's a start I suppose.\n\nLET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Avid is fucking out, finally I don't have to engage with this piece of shit ED anymore, fucking fantastic news.\n\nFly Me to the Moon barely beating Kibun Joujou, tragic but I guess people like five seconds worth of visuals in 90 seconds.... laughable.\n\nAh fuck man, the bland ass AnoHana ED won. Not that I cared much either way, just a shame to see. Six votes differential is pretty crazy though.\n\nAYYY with six votes Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no You na also won however, so this is a trade of six votes I'll take every time.\n\nLmao. As a Re:Zero fan I have to say, the Re:Zero shilling is incredibly dumb. How is STYX HELIX beating Heart wa Oteage and Stay Alive eight votes from beating SStBS. All y'all Re:Zero fans need to calm the fuck down.\n\nOverall 4/8 yesterday, with two of those match-ups being worryingly close. Sucks to see the best Kaguya ED out already and to something that's shit too. But it is what it is I suppose. With yesterday's results the only EDs remaining in bracket B that even reach mediocrity is Lost in Paradise, Uso, Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no You na and Sugar Song to Bitter Step, and they're all pretty damn good.

The visuals alone can describe Eren's role and progression in the series better than most people could put into words, and the different symbolisms are quite important for it as they are reflecting the progression. Add the lyrics to that, and you have an ED as good for a series as it can get. Voting for Kigeki is totally understandable, of course, it is wonderful and will definitely be a deserving winner.

Obviously referring to the background between him and Mikasa.\n\nThe imagery then transitions into a bird flying about before a birdcage appears that Eren breaks free from. This of course relating to Eren's strong desire for freedom and portraying what that freedom does for him.\n\nThen we get a sequence with environmental shots and adult Eren walking about in the flower fields, this depicting a world state more serene and natural than the societies of humans, while depicting Eren burning up with a blue flame, telling us he does not have a place in a world as serene as this.\n\nIt has these three different story threads it explores which has no or a very vague connection to one another. And while an ED can explore several different narrative ideas, usually this is done through symbolism or by having another unifying aspect as the focus point of the ED such as a unique aesthetic. Akuma no Ko doesn't have this, the narrative and \"freedom\" thematic is at the core of the ED, so why have such unconnected segments to one another?\n\nIt's not bad mind you, but when it has such glaring flaws and it's up against the best the contest has to offer, that becomes a fairly one-sided affair. Which is why I can't really think of anything Akuma no Ko has to offer, that Kigeki doesn't do better.\n\nI do however recognize that there is a chronological progression to these events as they reflect the story, it's just the thematic approach that is rather lacking.", "ups": 1, "depth": 2, "author": "Cryzzalis", "replies": [{"selftext": "&gt;It has these three different story threads it explores which has no or a very vague connection to one another.\n\nBut I see a very clear connection. The bird sequence comes from a very childish wish which he grows up with. But then it doesn't hold up to the reality of an adult. It all transitions very fluently into the next part. The bird morphing out of the scarf to fly away, then hitting the birdcage but in the process birthing colour into the world and creating a new and much clearer scenery that adult Eren gets to explore and subsequently vanish from. Eren's progression in the series is why the bird sequence differs so strongly from what comes after, they wouldn't just use such different styles without reason.\n\nNot liking the progression is one thing, absolutely fair, but I do find the intention behind it to be pretty obvious - and that's not even taking the song into account.

I even got to keep the last of my big three. Thanks to all the real ones out there who voted for **Sugar Song to Bitter Step**, we are gonna need some real luck against **Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no You na** as it is another ED that is making an incredible run through the bracket. On to the other matchups. **Styx Helix** over **Heart wa Oteage** is *madness*, what in the nine hells are y'all on Re:Zero fans? Don't think I didn't see **Stay Alive** come within spitting distance of my last ED either. Also, **Nandemonaiya** moved on again, this makes it ***5 FUCKING TIMES*** the damn thing has made it to top 16 or better. At least the righteous fury pushing **Uso** forward will swallow it whole just as **Avid** was, finally, consumed and removed.\n\n**Discussion Prompt**\n\n* I feel pretty disqualified from this one based on how much bitching I do about the visuals not being weighed as heavily. I have been very clear, all the way back to nominations, about which EDs are visually striking and the myriad ways that they are interesting to me. I am a huge fan of all the K-on! EDs, and of pretty much any ED that is a music video or stage play. Too many to list here.\n\n\nHere are today's votes!:\n\n* [Chikatto Chika Chika](https://v.animethemes.moe/KaguyaSamaWaKokurasetai-ED2.webm) - I finally get to vote for this monument to mo\u00e9. What a cool idea for a one-off that really nails down Chika as this goofy-ass airhead that nonetheless is very observational. I love the shoutouts to the lost chapters with her releasing the roach at the end as a fun easter egg for manga readers. The use of the remixed school bell is a fun way to start the beat and its neat that we are getting into Chika's whole rap and hip hop thing this early in production. It really shows that A-1 pictures believed in the full adaptation from the beginning. The way Chika copies the mannerisms of the council as she states their names is adorable and Konomi Kohara just sounds like she is having the time of her life doing the vocals for this on. It just dumpsters **Sentimental Crisis** in every way as an ED for Season 1.\n\n* [Akuma no Ko](https://v.animethemes.moe/ShingekiNoKyojinS4Part2-ED1.webm) - This was very tough to decide. The vocals in **Akuma no Ko** soar so majestically while **Kigeki** holds down a smooth and supple croon. The visuals for AoT are stark and brutalist while still exploding into soft hills and crisp skies while the SxF visuals bounce to the beat and are ever shifting and ever changing to drag your attention by force. The focus of Eren's journey shows the crushing finale of a life for a kid who has just been dragged into a hell of his own creation while Anya dazzles us with a dreamlike wonderland of family bonds and friendly communities of choice. The damn EDs are so similar, so different that I honestly just chose the one that beat my former big three member **Hare Hare Yukai** as the tiebreaker.\n\n* [My Nonfiction](https://v.animethemes.moe/KaguyaSamaWaKokurasetaiS3-ED2-NCBD1080.webm) - The most creative and *wild* Kaguya ED goes up against the most mid Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood ED. **Shunkan Sentimental** ain't as bad as **Let It Out**, but it's not as good as **Uso**. Sitting on the fence in a comfortable middle position is not even close to being enough to unseat **My Nonfiction**. This is one of the most impressive EDs I have ever seen. A-1 pictures has hired a madman that is willing to change genres, vocal direction, *the animation*, and anything else in order to craft a brand new chapter of a story that *isn't even being told*. Every second of breakdancing is as impressive as it is hilarious to see out of our local failboy and failgirl Ishigami and Iino. I can't help but grin whenever I see these idiots hit a flip or a head spin. Let's not even get started on the k-pop ass song that is hype and technically impressive in equal measures from the first beat to the last frame. One of the front runners to win the whole thing and one of the few EDs that I would be okay with if all of my choices get kicked out.\n\n* [Torches](https://v.animethemes.moe/VinlandSaga-ED1-NCBD1080.webm) - It feels kinda awkward that after all those paragraphs of text I have to end on this matchup. It really comes down to two things. Aimer is an incredible vocalist whose range and power captivate the heart and soul, and the final half dazzles with breathtaking timelapse shots of the boundless ocean, the sea of stars, and the majestic northern lights being used to show that our characters and their struggles are so very small in the end. Like a torch falling down a cavernous well that stretches into the core of the Earth. **Fukashigi no Carte** can't match that.

So, following Yuru Camp and Mob, Kaguya must axe one of their own. And like, undeniably it's Chika dance.

Beyond that, it really is a closing animation at the end of an episode. FMA has many strengths, but closers really isnt one of them. Meanwhile, it's peak Kaguya, simply put. I'm running out of ways to hype it up honestly.

Unfortunately the only two songs left, that I really, really like in this bracket, are up against each other:\n\n* ~~Sentimental Crisis~~ \\- Chikatto Chika Chika\u2661:   \nThe war of Kaguya Season 1 ED's. I think I do slightly prefer the Chika dance.\n* **Akuma no Ko** \\- **~~Kigeki~~**:   \nBoth EDs I absoultely love and it's a shame to see them face each other. Akuma no Ko I have propably heard so much, that if u wake me in the middle of the night and ask me to, I propably could sing the complete song by heart. I think it has ver beautiful shots and I love how it portrays the story of Eren. I also love the Eren-themed ED at a point of the anime, where we don't get any scenes from Eren's POV and are kept guessing what his true intentions are, as I think it adds to the mystery.   \nAs for Kigeki, I just love how it walks us through all the waku waku moments of Anya's live. And man Anya is just such a cutie. It's very hard to find anything to dislike in this ED. The song is also very catchy and fits the visuals perfectly.In the end it's a very close vote for Akuma no Ko, but I'm sad either way, no matter who loses.\n* ~~Shunkan Sentimental~~ \\- My Nonfiction:   \nShunkan Sentimental is imo the worst ED left in this bracket. Really don't like the song very much and don't think visuals are anything special either. My Nonfiction, while not my type of music, is at least a good song and is very nicely choreographed.\n* Torches - ~~Fukashigi no Carte~~:   \nVinland Saga does have 3 better ED's than Torches in [Drown](https://animethemes.moe/anime/vinland_saga/ED2-NCBD1080), [Without Love](https://animethemes.moe/anime/vinland_saga_season_2/ED1) and [Ember](https://animethemes.moe/anime/vinland_saga_season_2/ED2), but Torches is still good enough to beat the snoozefest that is Fukashigi no Carte.", "ups": 3, "depth": 0, "author": "Ceryto2", "replies": [{"selftext": "Well, I've found someone who voted all the same song as me.

Underrated. But I would say that is true of any anime that is more than 10 years old and how it is perceived in the west.\n\nMost of the qestern fan base tends to skew younger, and so once a series becomes \"older\" you begin to lack a historical context from which to appreciate something from. Also, media literacy is not exactly well taught in America (can't speak to other western countries, but the US definitrly has the most purchasing power when it comes to anime/manga).\n\nThis is also why anime that at one point seemed near universally watched or well regarded; Lucky Star, TMO Haruhi Suzumiya, Azumanga Daioh, Outlaw Star, Samurai Champloo, Ouran High School Host Club, Last Exile, Excel Saga, and more, are now borderline niche titles. Only the few massive megahits, or shows that have gotten remakes, escaping that obscurity.\n\nThere's lots of examples of this. People lauded Madoka Magica at the time it came out as \"revolutionary! a dark deconstruction of the magical girl genre\" many of whom hadn't consumed older magical girl anime or manga like Revolutionary Girl Utena, or the Sailor Moon manga, which get wildly dark. (Don't misinterpret here, I love Madoka, but it being a dark magical girl show was not what made it unique)\n\nThere are many examples like this, especially when we start talking about shows that were popular in Japan and influenced other manga/anime or the creators behind them, but never popped off the same way in the western fandom.\n\nHell look at Go Nagai's body of work, you'd be hard pressed to find a lot of people who know who the fuck he is, but the influence of his works can be found through the medium.

[Here are the shows Amusement Media has been a part of](https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1401/Amusement_Media_Academy). Seems like a lot of those are low budget, niche shows. And it seems like their subsidiary, Production Ace, is a voice acting talent agency. Maybe, the company wants to use the anime to promote their voice actors. That probably explains why they are in the production committee.\n\nBased on that information alone, my **guess** is that Kodansha (the LN publisher) probably wants to have as many of their properties get adapted into anime. You can see that with other Kodansha anime airing this year (i.e. Jitsu wa Ore Saikyo Deshita, The Great Cleric, A Galaxy Next Door, Saving 80000 Gold for my Retirement, My Home Hero). Surprisingly, all of the shows I just listed were Crunchyroll co-productions.\n\nWhich leads to my second guess about how CR \"co-funded\" this one. [Remember when Toshio Okada mentioned in one of his videos that a large investment from foreign companies would be split into separate projects to keep those companies lower down in the production committee?](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2023-03-02/animator-supporters-project-posts-toshio-okada-criticisms-of-production-committee-system-with-/.195481).

{"post": {"title": "Ueno from A Silent Voice is overly hated for the wrong reasons", "subreddit": "anime", "selftext": "I don't think she's a good person, nor do I think she's inherently a bad person, she's just someone who doesn't want to fight against the atmosphere, which is a topic that is often brought up in Japanese culture and her behavior and emotions are very human and believable.\n\nThis is how I believe she sees this situation. If you're different you're bound to end up being picked on in society and that's just how the world works. Due to her own personal feelings towards Shouya, she holds a grudge against her due to the injustice she believe he faced because if it wasn't him, someone else would had taken his place. She blames Shouku for destroying her relationship with him and she should had instead accepted her inevitable fate. In Ueno eyes, Shouko was fighting against the status quo, and she ended up causing trouble for the people who were caught up in her situation (i.e people who engaged in bullying her) as terrible as that may sound. She also held resentment with how she handled the situation with Shouya, because she followed the public perception. Given her devotion to Shouya in the later parts of the movie, you can see why her resentment towards Shouku ran so deep given all the above. She blames her for playing victim as she continues to bring people down with her, being the hand she was dealt at birth. She never once believed that the bullying she suffered was done out of evil, but rather an inevitability.\n\nUeno is a heavily flawed character, with a flawed ideology, but it doesn't minimize the issues she personally faces in her perspective. Given her point of view, Shouku was the bane of her existence, because she ruined a relationship she held dearly and it weighed on her for many years as evident with her reunion with Shouya.\n\nI don't agree with the way she handled the situation and her philosophy at all, but I can still feel somewhat empathetic towards her situation in her messed up way of thinking, which is why I could never truly hate this character. Don't get it twisted, I don't like her either but I don't think she deserves to be one of the most hated villains in anime.

Her growth ran parallel to Shoya's, except she fell very very short. We see Shoya actually feel burdened with guilt and really seek out to atone for his actions. Ueno provides a foil to this, how some people resist changing and improving, but even they aren't necessarily too far gone. I would argue if Ueno actually became a nice person who seeked redemption (which would make fans like her a lot more), it would feel a little cheap since we didn't get to see her growth and it would feel out of character.

I think most of them feel very real. However, that doesn't mean I do not hate Ueno for -one- reason, and one reason only. The beatdown outside the hospital. Kids not knowing better acting horribly is one thing, heck, a slap in the face may is wrong but I can kind of understand in the spur of the moment. BUT the beat down is completely strikes her out in my book.\n\nElementary Ueno, I am willing to accept was a victim of circumstances (more specifically, the school being ill equipped to handle kids with disability). One thing that is important to note is that the elementary school stuff was mainly viewed from kid-Shouya's point of view, and elementary Shouya was really an ignorant idiot/bully so he would either not pay attention resulting in certain important interactions getting glossed over.\n\n(Source: Author Q&amp;A in the official fanbook) One thing that get glossed over (due to the POV), is that Ueno was initially nice to Shouko. She was social person, so it is pretty much in her nature to reach out and make friends. The problem is that with the two being sat next to each other, Shouko would continue get Ueno to help her when she couldn't follow class. And since Shouko's disability is permanent, this isn't like helping a classmate once or twice to catch up, it was something that would never end, and the interruption would also affect Ueno's own ability for follow class (this is shown in the scene when she mentioned not being able to hear what the teacher said but that isn't meant to be a one off). i.e. Ueno was getting stressed out. Worse yet, whenever Ueno didn't do well, she'd get scolded, while Shouko would get a pass (the example show was the reading class - and again, this isn't supposed to be a one off). This lead to even more stress. So when she saw Shouya having so much fun tormenting Shouko for the lolz, and only then, she decided to join in pretty much to get back at what she saw as the source of her stress. It's definitely wrong, but I think that given the circumstances, and giving her age, I'll was willing turn the page on that. The problem again for me, is 100% her use of physical violence later on.\n\nThe author also mentioned in the interview in the fanbook that that Shouko actually understood why Ueno resented her back then and that is why she tried really hard to reach out and apologise to Ueno specifically. The elementary Shouko wasn't able to stop trying to rely on Ueno even when Ueno initially sent tried to put some distance between them. It's not really like Ueno was mean from day one, or went from nice in day one, and bully the next day, that part of the story was really condensed, and again, seen from elementary Shouya's POV.", "ups": 2, "depth": 0, "author": "xTooNice", "replies": []}]}

In here the world is completely different.

Why the teacher decided not to interfere is clearly stated in the source material, someone has posted the quote in the source material corner if you interested. Why the school and morality has gone such extreme is fundamentally related to the world setting and history of magicians, which is beyond the scope of this season. Morality is always dynamic and changes with time. More ancient people accept one male with multiple female partners compared to nowadays. Part of the reason could be ancient men are usually short-lived because of wars and create imbalance in the number of males and females. The reduction in casualty in wars and the spread of Catholicism may have helped to shape our current view. Another example is how ancient people accept incest like the Habsburgs' because they thought it helps to preserve their precious bloodline. Nowadays we are disgusted by it. That is because we have learned that children born from incest marriage will deteriorate the genes and we have passed down the knowledge though generations of educations and it becomes part of our morality. When watching this show it is important to think independently and don't use our standard of morality to judge. It is rare nowadays author decided to pull off a morally different universe, either because it is very difficult to do as it requires lots of imagination, or author want to write something that is close to their sense of morality, because they \"feel better\" to write something close to their point of view or they are trying to sell their morality to you.

N and Cynthia are incredibly powerful trainers because their kindness allows them to catch and train especially powerful Pokemon that most trainers wouldn't even be able to handle. With Moltres, Liko's shown that she can do the same. Besides, her current team can already dole out more than enough extremely psychopathic violence when fully evolved so they'll probably raise her into a Champion-level battler even if that's not her own goal. She clearly loves cute Pokemon (that just so happen to evolve into extreme violence machines) so Tinkaton's only a matter of time, too.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nLiko and Roy both have battling styles representative of their starters' hidden abilities and signature moves:\r  \n\r  \nFlower Trick always crits and never misses, which means every use is tailored to overcome any defensive advantages the opponent may have.

It seems to be a trend with season 3 of this anime, but I was 50/50 on it - and I don't mean I was ambivalent. Honestly, the first half was pretty cringy to me, but it more than made up for it with the second half, which I considered to be pretty great. \n\nNow, the first 10 minutes felt way too much like a generic RaG episode. Like no joke, this is the sort of stuff that would be in season 1. I do admit this may be due to me having watched A Gene of AI right before this episode, and we had a REALLY good episode on that today. I went back and skimmed through it, and it wasn't terrible as long as you trim down the simping. But seriously, things like people on the sidewalk talking about how Chizuru is a literal goddess and stuff was incredibly cringy. I gotta say though - and this is a point shared later on when the episode gets decent too - I really like Mizuhara's banter today. There's this sarcastic and cool tone she has whenever she \"breaks the fourth wall\" of the date, and it really adds to the funny atmosphere.\n\nI feel like the episode got a bit better after they finished the movie. One thing of note is that despite Kazuya being this much of a loser, is still apparently a bit of a normie. Didn't exactly expect that. Mizuhara gushing about the movie was pretty nice, as I like it when people talk about things they are passionate about. But the best part was definitely the talk at the restaurant. Mizuhara telling Kazuya that she knows he's just trying to cheer her up as well as Kazuya dies inside was absolutely hilarious, as was Kazuya trying to think of the encouragement the other girls gave him. The heartfelt conversation between the two was definitely the best part though. Kazuya and Mizuhara talking about granny Sayuri's final moments was definitely the highlight here. \n\nThe episode was much more bearable here on in! Honestly, full power lecherous Kazuya was much less annoying than Kazuya normally. Kazuya freaking out over the stretches' was a little cringy alright, but the way he gave Mizuhara tips on how to climb better was definitely pretty awesome. And the high-five was great too!\n\nWhile it's not Kazuya's fault, seeing the granny and the little girl at the fancy restaurant definitely might have triggered Mizuhara's emotions here. Still, I feel like she did enjoy the food, and so did Kazuya. \n\nWe got the ED from episodes 8 and 9 in scene form! Though this is probably pretty miserable for Mizuhara given that the fireworks probably touched up on a critical memory here. Honestly, I'm really surprised Kazuya couldn't figure it out himself and kept genuinely wondering if she was alright. Of course she's wearing a mask! Chizuru just puts on a tough face in front of everyone else, but she's just as human as anyone else. And on that note, I suppose it's up to Kazuya to try and cheer her up, this time for reals.

My \"score\" has averaged slightly less than half so this is a bit of a consolation. Of the two pick that lost, Koko kara\\^2 really couldn't have expected to take on a heavyweight like Kigeki. Koko kara\\^2 had a bit of an X-Factor on paper it isn't that special so yeah.. As someone who hasn't watched either show, Dango Daikazoku lost the battle of meh. I won't miss it all that much, but I wonder if Torches will be able to able to pick up where Koko kara\\^2 left off by taking on more heavyweight (whatever I might think of Fukashigi no Karte, can't ever underestimate the 5th seed).\n\nToday's vote:\n\nLost in Paradise vs **Chiisana Bokensha**: I must admit I am a bit meh about both. I have voted for both once this tournament (different round). The animation in Lost in Paradise is cool, but music isn't for me. Chiisana Bokuensha is a bit *too* peaceful - I mean the show is pretty light hearted but a bit more energetic.. All in all, it's very close, but I'll go with Chiisana Bokensha because I like the music a tiny bit more.\n\nSTYX HELIX vs **Heart wa Oteage**: STIX HELIX is another ED I only voted for once in the tournament. Heart wa Otaege has everything from the feel (this is what matters to me the most really), animation, music, and does well paying homage to Starship Troopers.\n\n**Nandemonaiya** vs Ouchi ni Kaeritai: Ouchi ni Kaeritai is pretty much like Chiisana Bokensha with a bit less animation right? Nandemonaiya has -no- animation so does the music make up for it? It has plenty of feel for me, so I'll go with a yes. I do note that had I not seen and enjoyed Your Name, I would most likely vote differently.\n\nUso vs **Avid**: Same as the above, I get the feel through the music. I honestly don't know which one I'd vote for if Avid and Nandemonaiya end up facing each other. However I will add that I like Uso a lot more than Ouchi ni Kaeritai, so this is close enough that if Uso wins, I'd be kinda okay with it.\n\nFly Me to the Moon vs **Kibun Joujou\u2191\u2191** :  I've voted against Kibun Joujou every round except the first round and immediately regretted it, but for this round up, 100% Kibun Joujou. I feel like Fly Me to the Moon doing so well largely through it's status as a classic.\n\n**Secret Base \\~Kimi ga Kureta Mono\\~** vs The Real Folk Blues: So much feel for Secret Base. Look, even as someone who love 86 ED music, I had to vote for Secret Base last round. And, controversionally, I am not a big fan of The Real Folks Blues, so this one was easy for me.\n\nROUNDABOUT vs **Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no You na**: Feel, music, visual, I like Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no you na more. Again, controversial view, but I am just not big on Jojo OP and ED. The only one I voted for, I want you, I heard it from way before it was used as a Jojo ED, and it's arguably quite un-Jojo like.\n\n**Stay Alive** vs Sugar Song to Bitter Step: I'd put Stay Alive on my longer playlist (not quite my \"Best of Best\" playlist), but I wouldn't put Sugar Song to Bitter Step. Visually I'll give it to the later and perhaps I might appreciate it more if I had seen the show and knew the characters.", "ups": 5, "depth": 0, "author": "xTooNice", "replies": [{"selftext": "Discussion Prompt:\n\n1000% four-brackets for me (especially for OP/ED). And even then, I don't think it would hurt to give two days on the first day. \n\nThe reasons being:\n\n1. This applies to OPs to some extend too, but especially to EDs - with some ED going above 1.5min, it takes hours to go through even 64, let alone 128 ED. Even with some skimming, it still takes a looooong time. \n2. Even if we say that two days is fine for going over 128 OP/ED and vote for them, it is still way too much to read and comment on. On the first day I posted my votes without any comments and it was already a wall of text. I don't think many would want / have the time to read that, let alone any additional comments that would take too long to type anyway. Similarly, while I often enjoy reading people's comments, even relatively long ones by frequent commenters, I could only skim past them in the first round. Even in the second round, I didn't have enough time to finish commenting let alone read all the comments.\n\nFurther note: While I don't think there would be enough interest given the relatively low voting numbers to host something like this, I personally would find it interesting if there was a \"Best of the rest\" or \"Second league\" for those contest. The current contest are kind of filled with the most popular and best known OP/ED, and while that is what you want for a \"Best OP/ED\" contest, as far as finding hidden gems goes, it's a bit limited (in relation to yesterday's Discussion). I suspect that the hidden gems could be found among the ED that didn't make it. Of course, since nominations were kindly released, I could (and might) slowly go over it myself and there is no need to actually have a contest for it, but admittedly I would be more inclined to look at OPs and EDs during contests.", "ups": 3, "depth": 1, "author": "xTooNice", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "Ah today's results get the salt flowing... Only 3/8 of my votes made it and some of my favourite songs didn't make the cut. Especially **Nai Nai** losing is really sad and propably mainly due to the Kaguya-factor.

Lost in Paradise however is just a standalone much better song and has visuals that really stand out.\n* **STYX HELIX** \\- ~~Heart wa Otaege~~:   \nI like how the third Kaguya ED portrays a whole little story and how it contrasts with the first Kaguya ED, the song however isn't for me. STYX HELIX however is just a very good song, therefore my vote goes there.\n* ~~Ouchi ni Kaeritai~~ \\- **Nandemonaiya**:   \nSame as above for Konosuba as both songs are very similar. Nandemonaiya however is one of RADWIMPS best songs. This vote goes to Kimi no Na wa's ED for the song alone.\n* ~~Uso~~ \\- **Avid**:   \nWhile Uso is FMAB's best ED, so is Avid for 86. And well, when Sawano buts out such a banger I don't need more than two pictures to like the ED.\n* **Kibun Joujou\uffea\uffea** \\-  ~~Fly Me to The Moon~~:   \nIf I want to listen to Fly me to The Moon, I think I prefer Frank Sinatra's version. And Kibun Joujou\uffea\uffea is just such a feelgood song.\n* **secret base** \\- ~~The Real Folk Blues~~:   \nIdk, I just love secret base, just a beautiful song and every time I hear it I do feel a bit emotional over AnoHana. Don't really have that connection with Cowboy Bebop's ED, even though it also is a very good song.\n* **Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no Youna** \\- ~~Roundabout~~:   \nIt's Sayuri's last song left and it's a banger. I love the slow buildup and the eventual explosion in the second half. Also the visuals in the second half are very beautiful. Roundabout however I can't even really take serious, because all i can think about is To Be Continued. Also don't think the song is nearly as good.\n* **Stay Alive** \\- ~~Sugar Song to Bitter Step~~:   \nI love the cute visuals and singing by Rie Takahashi. SStBS, while I do think the funky style is pretty fun, it always feels like I have heard enough of the song after like 20 secs and don't really wanna continue. And while the dance is pretty fun, I don't think it puts it over Stay Alive for me.\n\nFunnily enough none of my favourites meet today, therefore all matchups are pretty onesided for me.

Heart wa Oteage and Chika Dance are the best Kaguya EDs as well.\n* **Nandemonaiya** vs Ouchi ni Kaeritai - I've been wanting a good reason to vote against Nandemonaiya, but Ouchi ni Kaeritai isn't quite there\n* Uso vs **Avid** \\- Avid might be mostly stills, but those stills are absolutely gorgeous (and the song is great too).  It's another example of an ED that's pacing benefits from the [credits showing up on screen](https://youtu.be/vMdlbE-MzF8?si=r-_N352CXx07g7hG)\n* **Fly Me to the Moon** vs Kibun Joujou\u2191\u2191 - Rotating Rei\n* Secret Base \\~Kimi ga Kureta Mono\\~ vs **The Real Folk Blues** \\- The day that The Real Folk Blues loses will be a truly dark day.

One normally wouldn't expect the vote difference to be that close given their seeding, which theoretically would be a red flag for Chikatto Chika Chika, but Nai Nai was definitely an underseeded favorite of the tourney, and I expect Chikatto Chika Chika to beat Sentimental Crisis handily (Kaguya Season 1 cannibalism matchup hehe, I just realized)\n\n* I'm sad that Refrain Boy barely lost to Sentimental Crisis, glad to see the Kaguya OPs will cannibalize each other next round though, that's the best karma we could get.\n\n\n* Shunkan Sentimental upset Memento, let's goooo. I'm pretty low on all the Re:Zero EDs tbh, so the more get eliminated, the better for me.\n\n* Dango Daikazoku loses to Fukashigi no Carte, damn. This is by far Dango Daikazoku's worst placement (only Top 32), especially in recent tournaments, where it most recently placed 2nd, 2nd, Top 4, Top 4, Top 16, and Top 8.

I've never gotten the hype for Lost in Paradise visually or song-wise [I guess I just don't care about fluid character animation])\n* [STYX HELIX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqNyY_YL0sI) vs **[Heart wa Oteage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVoz_fH59Ew)** (Styx Helix is maybe the most boring ED that's not a movie/credits/insert ED, there's just nothing there for me. Heart wa Oteage has a fun/creative visual concept, and the song is also better, so it gets my vote)\n* [Nandemonaiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n89SKAymNfA) vs **[Ouchi ni Kaeritai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AubeXRKtU8U)** (While Ouchi ni Kaeritai does not have the worldbuilding that Chiisana Boukensha does, it still has a very atmospheric and calming feeling with its visuals. Meanwhile, Nandemonaiya is easily my least favorite ED remaining, as the only one over 3 minutes and it being mostly credits, and probably hot take: I don't like the song at all, it's probably meant to emotionally grab me but I don't find Radwimps's vocals to be emotionally resonating, and the instrumental/music just isn't very sentimental in my opinion)\n* **[Uso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHbUcpXypd8)** vs [Avid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4HlfCR2Wvk) (Uso has a fun rock song with fun visuals. Avid has dreadful-looking visuals and I'm a balladphobe, so this is an easy vote.)\n* [Fly Me to the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2AyJTOR_qw) vs **[Kibun Joujou \uffea\uffea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0njrO-Qb0u8)** (Kibun Joujo is a fun pop song with cute visuals.

The four-bracket system really drags at the Top 32 and Top 16, and the cons of that outweigh the cons of the two-bracket system where you're voting for way too much at the Top 256/128 (and we can just implement a two-voting-day system for the early rounds like we did here).", "ups": 12, "depth": 0, "author": "Zypker125", "replies": [{"selftext": "Also, this isn't related to the Best ED tourney technically (OLD news), but I thought it would be personally interesting for me to retroactively do the same for the Top 32 of the Best OP tournament, that way I can somewhat compare how my favorites in the endgame fared in the OP tournament vs the ED tournament:\n\n1.

Losing **Dango Daikazoku** is worse because not only am I down another big 3, I can't in good faith vote for **Fukashigi no Carte** the same way I had **Akuma no Ko** carry on for **Hare Hare Yukai** because **Torches** is such a better ED. At least **My Nonfiction** has a free pass to top 8 now.\n\n**Discussion Prompt**\n\n* I much prefer the four-bracket method. Its easier for everyone to give deeper thought into their write-ups and into *actually listening* to everything when there is less to do each day. I can go through 64 EDs or OPs and 32 write-ups in about 40 minutes. This contest it took me close to 2 hours per write up at the beginning. That much mental exhaustion is too much for a lot of folks who just want to vote in the funny anime song contest. \n\n* Also, I don't know the math on this, but it *feels* like lower seeds get a better chance at success if there is more of a split to each bracket. That probably helped my favorites out in the previous contests. Whereas, in *this* one they seem to be dropping too early or not making bracket at all. \n\nOn to the votes!:\n\n* [Lost in Paradise](https://v.animethemes.moe/JujutsuKaisen-ED1-NCBD1080.webm) - This sucks for **Chiisana Boukensha** as it normally makes it this far on the back of its immaculate vibe and comfy pastoral energy backed up by some intricate crowd shots and fun use of timelapse. Unfortunately, it has *slammed* into the brick wall that is **Lost in Paradise**, the king of vibes and positive energy. Lots of bad luck in the seeding this year I guess, lol.\n\n* [Heart wa Oteage](https://v.animethemes.moe/KaguyaSamaWaKokurasetaiS3-ED1-NCBD1080.webm) - This Kaguya ED just has *so much* going for it. The references are funny and pulled off with expert aplomb, the music is uplifting and flows very well, and the animation is fantastic. I just can't think of a reason beyond Myth &amp; Roid's mastery of the haunting and melodic to vote for **Styx Helix** over this. The OP and ED directors were really cooking in season 3 of Kaguya.\n\n* [Ouchi ni Kaeritai](https://v.animethemes.moe/KonosubaS2-ED1.webm) - Yeah, yeah, you've heard it all from me already. Blah, blah **Nandemonaiya** is Satan. Blah, blah best Konosuba ED of the three. Blah, blah can't believe a credit roll made it this far. Kinda just aghast that this dull brick of an ED is probably gonna make it to round 5 or better *4 times in a row*.\n\n* [Uso](https://v.animethemes.moe/FullmetalAlchemistBrotherhood-ED1.webm) - One more time, say it with me, *SID clears*. I think the trick with EDs like the dreaded **Avid** is that you have to overcome people's innate enjoyment of Hiroyuki Sawano before they remove the blinders and see how dull the actual ED itself is. I have great hope that adorable and technically impressive scribblevision animation *combined* with the buttery smooth and soulfully powerful SID is enough to swipe one of the last couple disgraceful EDs off the table.\n\n* [Kibun Joujou\u2191\u2191](https://v.animethemes.moe/ParipiKoumei-ED1.webm) - Ok, lets try this again. **Kibun Joujou \uffea\uffea** is most certainly a step down from **More One Night**, but its way better than the 5 frame music box on its way to sleepytime junction.\n\n* [The Real Folk Blues](https://v.animethemes.moe/CowboyBebop-ED1.webm) - This was a tough one for me. I kinda just gave up thinking and voted for the lower seed and for the jazz.\n\n* [Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no You na](https://v.animethemes.moe/BokuDakeGaInaiMachi-ED1.webm) - **Heikousen** FANS GET YO ASS IN HERE AND VOTE. Sayuri belts out another beautifully sung banger packed to the gills with attitude, color mastery, weird-ass metaphors, and gritty emotion.\n\n* [Sugar Song to Bitter Step](https://v.animethemes.moe/KekkaiSensen-ED1.webm) - The last of my big 3 to survive the contest. I can only hope that **Stay Alive** can be conquered now that I am done using it to knock out boring ass images and long credit sequences. I need my boys in UNISON SQUARE GARDEN to move on.

The konosuba ed on th eother hand is everything a slice of life ed should be. Song is fantastically whymsical and the visuals make you wish there would bea sol spinoff of konosuba-which is impressive considering konosuba already kinda is sol.\n\nSTYX helix vs **hear wa oteage** I have a personal connection to styx helix because I actually watched it before actually watching re;zero. Well, not really the ed, but more specifically this short [amalee english cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwHgJudJ_Rc) of sty helix which I fell in love with. And the japanese original cant exactly live up to that, even if the song was used really well in the show. And as u/Cryzzalis is probably glad to share, the visuals arent exactly special. On the other side we have heart wa oteage, the continuation of sentimental crisis...but the song cant live up to the original-and even if a lot more care and reference was put into the visuals, I think I also prefer the sentimental crisis visuals too. In a fight vs styx helix though, I think heart wa oteage still wins. ~~I still love both of them anyway.~~\n\n**Nandemonaiya** vs Ouchi ni Kaeritai: This wasn't easy, but my comment on ouchi ni kaeritai is the same as on chiisana Bokuensha, except worse visuals this time. Nandemonaiya on the other hand is something truly special\n\nAvid vs uso: Ok I would feel slightly hypocritical to celebrate dango getting voted out but then vote for avid almost solely because of how perfectly it and its visuals were used in the show, something I can't really explain to anybody who hasnt watched the show-the main problem I had with dango (I assume, since there has to be something about dango). Uso is also not bad visually. abstain\n\nRoundabout vs **Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no You na**: Oh..wow.

Small victories\n\n**Votes**\n\n* Chiisana Bouensha - It's just so warm and comfortable, like returning home from a long day and chillin with the bros over a beer. The panning city shots look like those decorative mountain city displays my parents would put out christmas season, so I'm just swarmed but that comfy mood when watching it. The music really is just bluegrass (Japan) but like, funky fresh can't top these rose tinted shades\n\n* Heart wa Oteaga - The other half to Sentimental Crisis and it has a Chika bald cap. Jokes aside, there's just much more going on visually here compared to Styx which is a whole lot more static character pans with a real solid song backing the scene. I do like the intentional older anime styling. It feels very 90s but with that modern lighting sparkle laid on top\n\n* Ouchi ni Kaeritai - [What did Mitsuha say when the comet hit?]&gt;!Ouchi!&lt;\n\n* Uso - I'm freakin livid 86 is still holding on out here in a contest that is both audio and visual. I mean the song's good sure but it's really overstayed\n\n* Kibun JouJou - Between the cute art style and the variety of stuff actually goin on, it gets my vote. Plus it'd be real funny to win both OP and ED. Eva's a certified classic at this point, but it suffers from 5 second loop syndrome. But hey, apparently 5 different beach walk versions is enough to move on, so surely 14 different 5 second walk cycles (and the whole being tied to pretty much *the* anime thing) will push Reink Sinatra. I just think KongMing deserves more one night here in the modern world\n\n* The Real Folk Blues - I mean yeah it's a powerpoint, but it does tell a story at the very least. Plus, jazz is a rare find here in EDville. Anohana is nice, but those flowers really do be falling and thats about it\n\n* Sore wa Chiisana Kikari no Youna - We're coming for that runback babyeee. Combining solid visuals, excellent foreshadowing, and the singer of [the best ED released 3 months too soon](https://v.animethemes.moe/LycorisRecoil-ED1-NCBD1080.webm) I'm not gonna vote for the funny haha meme who's most famous 5 seconds are the insert not included here. Erased sure had an ending, but the ED is fully picking up that slack\n\n* Sugar Song to Bitter Step - It's not just me right, but like, ReZero's EDs are just kinda... eh right? I can seriously get down with that speakeasy swagger, but ReZero is just a bunch of pans and neon outlines\n\n**Discussion**\n\nHoly hell never again *please*.

It captures the personality and attitude of the characters and the show super well, is really well animated and has a phenomenal song. It's definitely the better of the two.\n* ~~STYX HELIX~~ vs **Heart wa Oteage** \\- Quite frankly, STYX HELIX is a bit disappointing. It has a few interesting shots but overall is rather empty and doesn't utilize its time to show off the characters particularly meaningfully. On the other hand Heart wa Oteage uses imagery like the Zeppelin and the plane at the start to tie into Sentimental Crisis and mirror the two EDs, this time Miyuki being the one dreaming. It uses the story of Kaguya-hime and Kaguya's circumstances to move her to a different planet and spins the entire ED into a huge Starship Troopers reference. If you watch the scenes in parallel it does an amazing job with the reference while giving a unique spin to it which captures the characters and atmosphere of the series fantastically. It also shows off progression in the relationship of Kaguya and Miyuki super well, given that in Sentimental Crisis Kaguya is awoken at the student council room while in this case Miyuki was waiting for Kaguya for a date. If you're interested in seeing the reference material, while it doesn't capture all of the ED references, the [Klendathu Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hPNIwafEPw) sequence captures most of it.\n* ~~Nandemonaiya~~ vs **Ouchi ni Kaeritai** \\- Not huge on either, but it's a credit roll against a slightly worse than Chiisana Boukensha Konosuba ED, but still wholesome ED in Ouchi ni Kaeritai.\n* **Uso** vs ~~Avid~~ \\- Fuck Avid.\n* ~~Fly Me to the Moon~~ vs **Kibun Joujou\u2191\u2191** \\- Fly Me to the Moon may be a classic song, but it's not even that great of a song IMO. In addition it's just a repeating five second loop over and over for 90 seconds. Kibun Joujou isn't great either, but at least it has some fun interactions and pretty solid expressiveness.\n* *~~Secret base \\~Kimi ga Kureta Mono\\~~~* *vs* ***The Real Folk Blues*** *-* Pretty close one, but Secret Base does pretty much nothing other than the color shift and being emotional songwise. The Real Folk Blues has a much better vocal performance, more interesting instrumentals and uses its grayscale filter fairly decently, especially with the lack of the color drain on the rose.\n* ~~ROUNDABOUT~~ vs **Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no You na** \\- Not even a contest. ROUNDABOUT is just a side scrolling ED with some Mayan(?) imagery in the background, Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no You na is aesthetically interesting, creates a narrative progression that reflects the series with starting out in the Fujinuma kitchen and getting ever closer to Kayo and references Japanese literature like \"The Spider's Thread\". Also Sayuri clears.\n* ~~Stay Alive~~ vs **Sugar Song to Bitter Step** \\- Much better song, but SStBS also does a wonderful job at showing off character dynamics, exploring Leonardo as a character, setting up the \"Black\" and \"White\" dynamic for the final arc and show off character personalities in an innovative and interesting way. Also has a solid sense of progression in its increasing intensity of the visuals, which is something Stay Alive lacks as there is no reflection in the visuals of Stay Alive to match the song progression with the chorus drop. Which means that you could insert pretty much any somber song onto Stay Alive and it would synergize as well with the visuals as the original song does.\n\n**Top 3 EDs of the day.**\n\n1. Sugar Song to Bitter Step\n2. Heart wa Oteage\n3. Lost in Paradise\n\n**Discussion Prompt**\n\nPersonally I prefer the four bracket A, B, C &amp; D style. It feels like I have no time to digest things here. One day you're voting for things, the next day you're reacting to results, then as you take some time to digest and internalize results all of a sudden you're voting on the same set of entries. So the quadruple bracket works much better in my mind.\n\n(An addendum to make after reading /u/SometimesMainSupport's comment. Round 5 kinda sucks with the quadra bracket approach if you can't combine the remaining entries into a top 16, but I still prefer it.)\n\n**Reactions to yesterday's results**\n\nChikatto Chika Chika winning the first battle of the great EDs. Certainly my preferential pick, but a shame one of them had to lose. With that out of the way I'd like to implore the anti-Kaguya hype that's about to begin to please, focus on Chikatto Chika Chika, don't anti-Kaguya the other great EDs just because of this.\n\nNah man, Sentimental Crisis is nice but it should NOT be beating Refrain Boy which was the best ED remaining in the contest. At least we got within 15 votes, but that's actually tragic. I guess with that, the best remaining ED is Kigeki.\n\nKigeki upsetting the dark horse star KKx2, glad to see it. Would've been ridiculous to lose it already.\n\nKoi no Yukue unfortunately losing to Akuma no Ko, but I suppose they were fairly close for me anyways.\n\nMy Nonfiction did not win hard enough against Believe in You. It should've been at least a 200 vote difference or something, but glad to see the win at least.\n\nWow, Shunkan Sentimental pulled the upset. Don't think either ED is good, but really didn't expect Memento to lose out.\n\nFukashigi no Carte has broken the streak of losing to Dango Daikazoku.... sadly. Shame the right side bracket sucks so much.\n\nMichishirube losing to Torches in an upset fucking sucks. Torches has a great first 20 seconds or so and then is rather bland, while Michishirube actually has some cool character stuff going on. With that result, the only ED on the right side bracket remaining that's even at a mediocre level is My Nonfiction (which is great). Everything else that remains kinda sucks.\n\n3/8 yesterday, not good. But aside from Refrain Boy nothing of great value was lost.\n\nEDIT: On a sidenote, I went on a pretty long rant fanboying over Kigeki yesterday on stream. If you want to know just the extent of incredible detail in it, it may be worth watching that. Alternatively if you can't bother downloading the VOD, I have this long write-up I wrote on Kigeki during the reddit anime awards last year that covers it well. It's a bit dated and certain things I didn't understand about it back then I do understand now, but it's generally pretty solid.

I'll admit to hypocrisy with my Nandemonaiya vote, but in fairness it's also a spite vote against Konosuba :stuck_out_tongue:\n\n1. Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no You na over ROUNDABOUT - fuck the Jojo meme ending man, the visuals are more or less just one long pan firmly in the \"shit ED visuals\" category accompanied by a repetitive baseline with barely any notable melody to speak of. Erased's ED is so much better, especially around the half way mark when it really kicks it into top gear in the visuals and song.\n\n1. **Stay Alive** over Sugar Song to Bitter Step -  another \"fuck the meme/historic value\" vote, and Stay Alive's song has really grown on me while I couldn't care less about BBB's. BBB's visuals are firmly better I'll admit.\n\n1. **Nandemonaiya** over Ouchi ni Kaeritai - Konosuba's ED is just a bunch of stills and a folksy song that loses hard to Your Name's beautiful soundtrack. Also a hefty does of spite voting against Konosuba for beating out a much better ED in Unlasting, both in visuals and song.\n\n1. Heart wa Oteage over STYX HELIX - I like Re:Zero's song better, but it's super weak visually vs the great storytelling and Starship Troopers reference in Kaguya's ED.\n\n1. Kibun Joujou\u2191\u2191 over **Fly Me to the Moon** - Eva's mid af visuals (a beach walk that does not have char exploration as far as I can tell) have no business being in round 4. Just covering a Frank Sinatra song is not good enough, vs Kibun Joujou\u2191\u2191's high energy (even if it is also a cover, it's not relying on familiarity for a boost).\n\n1. **Secret Base ~Kimi ga Kureta Mono~** over **The Real Folk Blues** - sure, Bebop has a super groovy ED song, but Anohana's emotional ED that's used perfectly with a lead-in hits just as well, and the visuals put it way over the top, doing some storytelling/char exploration and kicking in hard at the chorus vs Bebop's slideshow.

That's probably a bad example since nobody is quite (or will likely ever be) as big as Miyazaki. What I mean is what directors or other staff are out there that can draw people to a project just on their name alone and who leave a signature touch to everything they touch.\n\nThe biggest names I can think of off the top of my head from recent memory are Shinkai, Yuasa, Imaishi, and Yamada. However, they've all have catalogues dating back over a decade. They also come with their own set of qualifications. From everything I can see, Yuasa seems to be taking a break from anime directing, Imaishi has just been recycling his vision on Netflix shows, Shinkai's always been hit or miss with his works (with his latest being a definitive miss), and Yamada's moved into the realm of much more niche works (I'm excited to see her upcoming film next year and loved *Heike Monogatari*, but that series was notoriously slept on and I don't see her movie next year making waves like her works used to). There doesn't seem to be any young new visionaries out there, and I want to know if that's just a matter of me not looking in the right places or is it just a sign of the times.\n\nI'm always looking for new people whose filmography I can explore, so I'm curious what young industry talents I might be sleeping on.", "ups": 6, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/16q5n21/who_are_some_of_the_biggest_rising_talents_in_the/", "num_comments": 13}, "replies": [{"selftext": "First name that comes to mind is Megumi Ishitani.

Yuuasa had a new film literally just last year, all of Shinkai's work has been hugely successful both critically and commercially (Suzume is the opposite of a definitive failure, it's a highly grossed film and imo it's his best to date and the only one I wholeheartedly love), Yamada's work isn't *that* niche (Heike is a well known story in Japan) and her next film is being distributed by a major company, and Imaishi making *one* show for Netflix isn't even a qualification, you say it as if having a defining style and making things for Netflix discounts him somehow. \n\nThese *are* the next rising stars. Miyazaki has been making anime since the 60's, and these guys are slightly beyond that point of Miyazaki's career. They're young, but they're names people know, they're making anime, their work is all universally acclaimed, these are the big directors of the day. The only other one I'd include is Mamoru Hosoda. Sure, I'd love to imagine that I could say Sunao Katabuchi or Hiroko Utsumi or Rie Matsumoto are good answers, but they actually do come with caveats. They are wonderful, but they are not stars rising into the mainstream (they're rising into general otaku knowledge), Shinkai, Yuaasa, Yamada, Imaishi, and Hosoda either already are mainstream or are right in the cusp of it.", "ups": 9, "depth": 0, "author": "Gamerunglued", "replies": [{"selftext": "&gt; Yuuasa had a new film literally just last year\n\nInu-Oh from what I can see was in production for awhile, and was announced prior to basically saying he wants to take a break back in 2020. \n\n&gt; Suzume is the opposite of a definitive failure.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Shinkai\u2019s movies are a financial success, but artistically they can be a little all over the place. *Weathering With You* was really good, but *Suzume* was disjointed and had too much going on to land any of it.\n\n&gt; Yamada's work isn't that niche\n\nI\u2019m admittedly coming from a more Western standpoint here, where *Heike Monogatari* wasn\u2019t nearly as big as some of her works in the 2010s or her breakout hit in *K-On!* and it doesn\u2019t look like *Kimi no Iro* will do that. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it will succeed, and Yamada has the star power to make that happen, but I don\u2019t see it making waves outside of the markets that would already be interested in them. Certainly not affecting a zeitgeist dominated by Shounen, though I\u2019d love to be wrong.\n\n&gt; Imaishi making one show for Netflix isn't even a qualification\n\nOk maybe that was a bit of a stretch. However, I think a lot of his latest output have just felt \u201cyeah that\u2019s Imaishi\u201d and not in a good way. *Promare*, Edgerunners, and his episode on *Star Wars Visions* don\u2019t have that same novelty that *Kill la Kill*, Gurren, or even *Dead Leaves* had back in the day.", "ups": 0, "depth": 1, "author": "Salty145", "replies": [{"selftext": "All of this is just your bizarre and frankly unpopular opinions being pushed as fact here. I disagree with literally every take here. Inu-On having been in production for a while doesn't really vouch for either point. During that time, Yuasa has also played producer roles on stuff like Yurei Deco, he's plenty active. I think Suzume is his most *focused* film to date, quite the opposite of being all over the place. Imo, his best and most emotionally impactful take on living with natural disasters to date, resulting naturally from an engrossing road trip flick with his best character writing to date. Suzume is the only Shinkai film I have above a 7/10, I think it's his outright best film artistically speaking. \n\nBeing less popular than one of the best selling anime of all time is one hell of a high bar. None of Yamada's work has hit that height of popularity since, but has all nonetheless been extremely visible. A Silent Voice and Liz and the Blue Bird had relatively impressive showings for these sorts of films, Heike did well in Japan, and Yamada is a director on the periphery of non-anime film circles as an up-and-coming big name. Kimi no Iro is being produced by [Story Inc.,](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/company.php?id=18817) which is a major production company, the same one that does Shinkai's last two films actually. This implies that Kimi no Iro is expected to be a hit, and that Yamada's name is a selling point. And Edgerunners isn't even similar to Imaishi's other work in terms of tone. Novelty has never been the appeal of Imaishi's work, confidence, style, and thoughtful theming has been, and that has been maintained in his recent output. \n\nI'll also remind that Mamoru Hosoda has been left out of the discussion, and I feel that he is the biggest rising star at the moment other than Shinkai. Anyway though, your personal opinions on these works have no bearing on the question you've asked. Even if you thought all of these directors made nothing but flops, they'd still be the rising stars.

Some cool animation for like 30 seconds during that confrontation with Challe, it is JC Staff after all, but then it was over. At least the fairies he recruited are finally free to live as they wish. \n\nBack to Paige workshop we go where everyone has been hard at work on the project for the festival. Christmas tree sculptures are really ideal for this time of year. They turned out beautiful thanks to everyone\u2019s hard work. \n\nMeh again, they\u2019re pushing Bridget\u2019s forgiveness arc.

Turns out compassion goes along way! Especially when Lafalle's soldiers make an exception for Anne and protect her while Lusul steals back Challe's wing! Take that \"Fairy King.\"\n\nI'm all pumped up for Challe and Lafalle's final battle, but then the soldiers arrive and Lafalle realizes he's screwed, thanks to Challe. Lafalle talks a big game about \"allies\" and treating Challe as a brother, but he never truly treated anyone as an equal and had to hold control over them to ensure their loyalty. He never had a true comrade. Is it any surprise that screwed him over in the end? Of course he just blames everything on the humans, but in this instance Anne did what he should've done and given Fairies their freedom. And rather than face Challe or the soldiers, Lafalle falls off the castle...though without a body, I doubt he's dead.\n\nIt was nice of Challe and Anne to give the Fairies back their wings and help them escape. It's kind of sad that Anne might never see Lusul again given her life expectancy, but at least she's got Challe back (again) and the two can hold hands now.\n\nAnne is back! And of course her first priority is checking to make sure they finished everything in time for the festival! And with the help of all the friends she'd gained along the way chipping in, they did! Of course Anne being Anne thinks they can go even bigger! Our girl is back to doing what she does best.\n\nI'm glad to see Bridget's character development has finally taken, to the point where she's comforting and opening up to Anne and now knows that she wants to help at the workshop in her own way. She also breaks off her engagement with Elliot, which kind of sucks for him, but it seems like it's for the best because she doesn't love him and Elliot's just happy she's doing what she wants to do now. Though it also helps that she's obviously in love with Orland!\n\nSo Challe does feel some kind of obligation to help out the Fairies in this world, even if his life with Anne takes precedent. He wants to be with her forever, after all. Which just makes it a little sad that each seems to want the other to achieve happiness and find love separate form each other when it's obvious they're both mutually in love with each other. If only Anne could be honest with her feelings.\n\nThe festival with all the crystal Christmas trees is a big hit! Anne really saved Paige Workshop! But now what should she do? As a Silver Sugar Master, she should be doing her own work, and the best way to accomplish that is getting back on the road. And of course she can't be out on her own so Mithril and Challe will join her once again.

I wish she would have apologized to both Anne and Challe but she's made great improvements already.\n\nLove her parallels the past few episodes. This episode when she  returns the blanket. When Collins was injured she wouldn't tend to him but then a few episodes ago she tended to Orland after being injured. She really is a sweet girl underneath and hopefully can make sugar confections again now that she's not the heir.\n\nOrland better watch out it seems like Bridget is ready to go after what she wants now and she definitely wants him, but I don't think he will mind at all. I wonder if she originally was infatuated with Challe because of his similarities with Orland and while at that time couldn't have Orland she could potentially have Challe.\n\nI would say a satisfying ending especially considering how the first half ended.

I liked the manga more, but the anime was good too. Held back by only having one arc.\n\nOne Punch Man: Loved. Action and animation were so good.

Nothing bad to say about it.\n\nMy Hero Academia: Stopped watching after a while. For no specific reason, I just lost interest.

If you end up enjoying Monster Pluto which is also by the same creator is coming out.\n\n- Bakuman - not the same genre (SOL drama with some romance focused on manga creation) but my the same creatives of DN and in my opinion their best work. Does have some elements of DN like the two MCs having to outsmart their rivals.\n\n- Psycho Pass S1 - main antagonist for that season is very similar to Light\n\n- Legend of the Galactic Heroes - Main MC duo trying to outsmart each other in a big space opera war drama. Watch the films My Conquest is Sea of Stars and Overture to a New War skip to EP 3 of the OVA. Second film covers the plot better. \n\n- Banana Fish - Crime drama with a smart MC. More action in here but still very good. \n\n- Ghost in the Shell FIlms and SAC - Good sci fi crime thriller. Honestly just dive into some of those like Ergo Proxy and Tecnolyze as well. \n\n- One Outs - not personally a big fan of it but lots of people do like this show. Kinda like if you combined DN with a baseball anime\n\n- Kaguya Sama Love is War - Just imagine if Light and L were in love with each other and then you made DN a rom com. \n\n- Great Pretender - All about heists \n\n**One Punch Man**\n\n- Mob Psycho 100 - same creator and honestly in my opinion way better than OPM\n\n\n\n**HxH 2011**\n\n- YuYu Haksuho - same creator as HxH\n\n- JoJo's Bizzare Adventure - Like HxH JoJo has a pretty creative battle system that leads to some of the more interesting fights I have seen out of the battle shonen genre. Like HxH also it takes a little bit of time for that power system to get going. Though unlike HxH JoJo starts off quite rough for it's first 9 episodes (Part 1) but once you get to Part 2 (EP 10) there is a dramatic increase in quality due to the new story, characterization and use of the power system. It just keeps ongoing with high quality after that. \n\n**Attack on Titan**\n\n- 86 - Mecha anime that hits on a lot of similar themes as later AOT\n\n\n- Blue Gender - Mecha anime that hits on a lot of similar themes of early AOT\n\n- Space Battleship Yamato - if you aren't up for older anime go watch the 2012 remake 2199.

They've bloated up so much following the merger with Funimation, and it feels like a house of cards ready to collapse inevitably. Combine that with a withering trust in their services, and a growing mistrust from partners (which is honestly a much bigger deal than a fanbase), and I wonder if what revenue they're making is even enough to support the foundation that they're standing on.

I predict that inevitably, Sony will either slash costs massively and \"enshitification\" happens, or divest of the entire CR venture.\n\nHiDive meanwhile has the misfortune of being owned by AMC Networks, which is struggling at the moment to create compelling shows that aren't The Walking Dead or Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul. Although they have managed to obtain higher quality shows under their new owner than they had in the past, their service remains subpar and their reach globally continues to be limited. Combine this with AMC's own struggles with transitioning away from cable to streaming with their own services like AMC+ and HiDive is in a volatile spot atm. I don't know if Sony is going to buy AMC Networks (and in turn HiDive), but a buyout by a larger studio is likely.\n\nAnd honestly, I have no idea what Disney is doing regarding anime. Evidently, the move to start acquiring shows exclusively for D+/Hulu began under Bob Chapek when he was CEO of the company, since he prioritized growth over anything else, so he signed off on Disney Japan getting exclusive rights to anime. But now, Bob Iger is back as Disney CEO after a heated battle, and it seems like he has the opposite view of Chapek regarding anime, since there hasn't been any major exclusives for Disney+ announced since last November (when Disney Japan announced their Kodansha deal that seemingly went nowhere outside of making future Tokyo Revengers seasons exclusive to D+, coincidentally a few weeks before Chapek was fired). Along with that, Disney has largely failed to really give any attention or marketing to their exclusive anime on D+/Hulu outside of Japan; and there's no guarantee that fans would want to sub to either service just to watch one of two shows that are exclusive to them, no matter how much they love Bleach. I suspect that Disney will no longer want to acquire any more anime once all of the shows they announced for this year and next year come out, and start sublicensing them. Combine that with Disney's plan to merge Hulu with D+ (which will cost even more money btw to buy the remaining minority stake from Comcast), and it's likely that Hulu's anime offerings, which also includes all sorts of sublicensed shows from other companies, including CR, is going to shrink further.\n\nThings get tricky then, because outside of Netflix, no other major streaming service (Max, Paramount+, Peacock, even Apple TV+) is particularly interested in streaming anime. You'd think that they'd want a piece of the pie too, but so far, they haven't bothered to do so. I just feel deeply pessimistic about the future of anime in the Western world, which is why I wrote this to begin with. Currently, we're seeing the big streaming services get hit massively and begin deteriorating over time, and I can't help but feel like something similar is about to happen to the niche services as well. These companies all bought these services at the height of the pandemic, during a time when we saw the big studios all set up streaming services and spend extravagant amounts of cash on content or even other studios for that purpose (i.e. everything Netflix bought out or Amazon's MGM acquisition), and now with increased interest rates, mounting debt and shrinking cash flows, on top of the streaming bubble bursting, it just feels like everyone is due for a reckoning in just a matter of time.", "ups": 0, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/16ql5oc/a_minimeltdown_of_the_niche_anime_services_is/", "num_comments": 16}, "replies": [{"selftext": "You're just going around and cherry picking negative and unknown things just to act like the sky is falling?", "ups": 29, "depth": 0, "author": "timpkmn89", "replies": [{"selftext": "Yea, this tends to happen anytime there's a major shake up in the big three platforms. \n\nThere's always going to be issues with any streaming platform regardless of the content.

I remember far darker days in the anime industry, such as when things collapsed for ADV, when things collapsed for  Pioneer/Geneon, when Bandai of America was shut down, when Cartoon Network, which was a primary source of anime restructured things and reduced the amount of anime they aired, or relegated them to Saturday late nights, etc... When the business model of anime in the US was physical media and relying on anime fans to pay $30 for a DVD with 3 episodes on it, or even worse, a VHS tape for $30 with 2 episodes on it and only one of sub/dub. That market collapsed as it inevitably was going to and things were rebuilt in far better (and, believe it or not, far cheaper) ways.\n\nAs for the companies, is Crunchyroll producing original content? Or just licensing anime? The big issues streamers are having is they are spending massive amounts of money producing original content that ultimately brings little to no actual revenue in. Disney Plus for example has lost money since its existence. If one is concerned about Disney, sure, I think its a dumpster fire right now. But I've never viewed Disney as a big source for anime in the west. In fact of the big studios/streamers from that operate in the west, Sony was the smart ones. They didn't follow the business model of ceasing to license their content to others, creating their own streaming service from scratch and spending absurd amounts of money producing original content for it. That's what is currently burning the companies like Disney and leading to things like the writers and actors strike because the service is losing a lot of money and isn't performing at the level that the old model of reliance on cable and network TV, syndication and physical media did.\n\nShould one be concerned that Sony/Crunchyroll has too much power in the industry? Yes. I'm one of many who is greatly mourning the end of Right Stuf. But them collapsing? They are the biggest player in the market by far, that is not happening.

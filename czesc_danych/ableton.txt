I unfortunately have not been able to afford ableton 11 so this may be pointless for some people as I am on 10 still. \n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening. \n\nI can run a project for whatever length of time and keep working on it and typically no issues besides random crashes (which is a whole other story)\n\nThe problem happens when I save the project and reload it. Everything sounds off. On all of my projects. Imagine if you closed a track you were working on and when you reopen it everything sounds squashed to hell like you threw a limiter on your track and didn\u2019t set it correctly. The only problem is\u2026. It did not sound like this before the project was closed and reopened. \n\nI have been trying to go back and redo every plugin and try to make things sound right but I know as soon as I close the project it\u2019s going to be messed up again. \n\nHas anyone experienced this? I can not find anything about this from multiple searches and I have missed multiple deadlines and been unable to make any releases lately because of this. Obviously this is extremely frustrating for a professional musician and I have been trying to deal with it for months by just leaving the projects running until they are done but this is just not feasible and ableton will usually destructively crash if the computer goes to sleep for any reason. \n\nAny help is appreciated and FYI: I have not been able to pinpoint any exact plug-in or anything particularly causing this which leads me to believe ableton is resetting something I can\u2019t see that is causing complete havoc on my projects. My only guess is something with delay compensation making all the plugins go out of time when it reloads. If that is the case then I\u2019m not sure what could possibly fix that but I need to get these projects finished desperately. \n\nThanks for any help \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "ups": 4, "permalink": "/r/ableton/comments/16xbrsr/ableton_is_messing_up_every_single_project_i_have/", "num_comments": 16}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I\u2019ve found some max4live devices load with their default settings instead of how I left them, maybe your issue is around there? \n\nNot ableton brand ones, 3rd party \n\nI wonder if something you\u2019re adding is resetting for some reason", "ups": 3, "depth": 0, "author": "FinancialFirstTimer", "replies": [{"selftext": "The closest answer I can figure out is that for this last particular project I have two exact copy synths that are exactly the same however one is mono and the other is stereo and has an ozone imager.

Not like emotionally bullshit, but logically. What is the limit?\n\nThe making a pencil discussion is great bc most of us just grab one from a drawer and start writing.\n\nBut if we put the requirement on every author that they had to make their own pencil, they would have to mine for graphite, refine rubber, run metal stamping machines, own a global supply chain just to produce essentially a $0.15 product that probably at least 20 companies are involved in making.\n\nFor music, most melodies ever made have some similar version. Most chord progressions have been used. Most emotional statements have been made in some capacity. Originality doesn't come from doing something that's NEVER been done before.

You can transport your clips into the arrangement view for further development, but you will never be able to make full songs in there, unless you have have a basic song structure without transitions etc.\n\n- the push 2 is great for people who aren\u2019t music theory literate, as it does allow you to play in key. The only problem is, is that you won\u2019t be making complex chords, as you will tend to go to the same shapes every time you hit the pads. The best way to counter this is to overdub your chords with individual notes.\n\n- the best thing about push 2 is the sampling in simpler and doing your drums. Doing harmonies and Melodys is always easier on a Keyboard imo.\n\n- push 2 is good for automation in a live setting, but near impossible in a arrangement setting, as you will need more precise control throughout your track.\n\n- the browser is cool but nowhere near as functional as pulling things with your mouse and keyboard.\n\nThat\u2019s all I have for now.

Click on the \"Random\" MIDI effect to open its settings in the bottom panel.\n\n6. Adjust the \"Chance\" and \"Choices\" knobs to control the probability of randomization and the number of sample slots that can be affected.\n\n7. In the \"Map\" section, you can map the \"Random\" device to specific parameters of your Drum Rack, such as sample slots or macro controls. Click the \"Map\" button, then click on the parameter you want to map in your Drum Rack.\n\n8. Use the \"Amount\" knob to control the range of randomization for the mapped parameters.\n\n9. Experiment with the \"Seed\" knob to change the randomization pattern.\n\n10. Play your MIDI controller or sequence some MIDI notes to trigger the Drum Rack, and you'll notice that the samples in the Drum Rack are randomized based on the settings you configured in the \"Random\" MIDI effect.\n\nBy using the \"Random\" MIDI effect in Ableton Live, you can add an element of unpredictability and variation to your drum patterns and compositions.", "ups": -1, "depth": 2, "author": "Holl0wayTape", "replies": [{"selftext": "lol this isn\u2019t at all what OP was asking to do.

The only thing I added to their question was \"in Ableton.\" This is an accurate response on the first try: \n\nIn Ableton Live, you can achieve randomized sample playback on a drum rack pad using the \"Random\" MIDI effect. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Load Your Samples:**\n   Make sure you have loaded your four kick samples onto different slots of a single pad in your Drum Rack.\n\n2. **Add a \"Random\" MIDI Effect:**\n   - Select the Drum Rack track where you want to apply the randomization.\n   - In the Device View (usually found in the bottom section of Ableton Live), click the \"MIDI Effects\" category on the left sidebar.\n   - Drag and drop the \"Random\" MIDI effect onto the Drum Rack track.\n\n3. **Configure the \"Random\" MIDI Effect:**\n   - Click on the \"Random\" MIDI effect to select it.\n   - In the \"Random\" device's settings, you'll see two sliders: \"Chance\" and \"Choices.\"\n     - Set the \"Chance\" slider to control how likely it is for a random event to occur when you hit the pad. For example, if you set it to 50%, there's a 50% chance that the sample will change when you hit the pad.\n     - Set the \"Choices\" slider to determine the number of different samples that can be randomly selected. In your case, set it to 4 since you have four kick samples.\n\n4. **Map the Random Effect to the Pad:**\n   - Click on the Drum Rack pad you want to randomize.\n   - In the bottom left corner of Ableton Live, you'll see a button labeled \"Key\" and a small icon resembling a key. Click it to enable MIDI mapping mode.\n   - Click on the \"Random\" MIDI effect's \"Chance\" slider.\n   - Hit the pad you want to map the randomization to. This will associate the randomization effect with that pad.\n\n5. **Adjust Preferences (Optional):**\n   You can further fine-tune the behavior of randomization by adjusting the \"Chance\" and \"Choices\" parameters to suit your preferences.\n\nNow, when you hit the pad you've mapped the \"Random\" effect to, it will randomly select one of the four kick samples each time, based on the chance you've set. This will give you the desired random sample playback effect.", "ups": 0, "depth": 4, "author": "Holl0wayTape", "replies": [{"selftext": "exactly. i got downvoted into oblivion here but chatgpt answers complex questions for me all the time. no longer do i need to ask reddit or spend hours going through youtube tutorials.", "ups": 0, "depth": 5, "author": "AndyP8", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"selftext": "then you don't know how to write good prompts. i use chatgpt all the time for these questions and get great responses. most recently, i asked it how to create different banks of midi mappings that i can switch between for 1 instrument. chatgpt nailed it.", "ups": 0, "depth": 2, "author": "AndyP8", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "plip.", "ups": 1, "depth": 1, "author": "manuelzmanual", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "This is your friendly reminder to read the submission rules, they're found in the sidebar.

Respectfully, Ableton built the best controller the market has ever seen although it only really works with their software.\n\nBefore I got a Push 2 I had an APC 40 MK2 and it was great. Build is all plastic so it was light but it didn't feel like a piece of expensive equipment. That said the knobs and faders were some of my favorite I've ever used on a controller (still prefer the APC knobs to my Push knobs). What I really loved the APC for was djing Ableton sets. The layout made a lot of sense in that regard, that being said that only felt so good because you map everything once in a template and then add songs when you want to dj, you never really had to remap controls mid set if you made a good template.\n\nThe beauty of the Push lies not only in its very deep feature set, but that 8 controls are automatically mapped for any native Ableton device. The amount of time this saves is MASSIVE. When producing with the APC I felt like I had 2 options. Set up a knob and remember what I set it up to for the entirety of production OR remap a knob whenever I need it. It's a pain in the ass. Personally for production, I don't know if I can recommend anything but the Push anymore. The APC line has also been discontinued so if it stops working one day it's done, no support.\n\nYou can also dj with the Push 2 but it's not as fun as it was with the APC 40. If you wanted to perform live with a Push the best method would be to incorporate actual jamming/improv into your set. Straight djing is definitely doable on the push but I'd opt for turntables and a mixer if I didn't intend on playing anything live.\n\nTLDR: The reason people are telling you to buy a Push is because it's worth it 10x over. Idk about the Push 3 but the Push 2 at $700 still remains the greatest piece of music gear I've ever purchased. The Push 3 line does look a little expensive though. The APC 40 MK2 is a great, lightweight controller that has a lot of the same controls (knobs, faders, pads) but is discontinued and will no longer receive support. And if you use it side by side with a Push I can guarantee you'd want to save for a few more months and just get the push. It's a little bulky but it's not that bad.\n\nAlso like a few others in this comment section, generally most Ableton producers with this question, end up at a Push 2. If you go through enough of these subs you'll find plenty of people like me who owned an Akai or Novation piece of gear and decided to bite the bullet with the Push and will never go back lol.", "ups": 5, "depth": 0, "author": "chilldpt", "replies": [{"selftext": "&gt;but that 8 controls are automatically mapped for any native Ableton device. The amount of time this saves is MASSIVE. \n\nevery controller with 8 knobs (or less; or more) can do this. either with included mapping or with creating a custom map (extremely easy in live 11). My keystep 37 is configured like this, I can do the same with my microfreak. \n\nYou're right that native device integration is unparralled in the push though as it gives you full control of the device with feedback and a dedicated UI. For vst it's very basic though and controllers like novation sl mk3 will do as well. \n\nPersonally I created a custom m4L instrument paired with a touchOSC layout; It will automap 16 knobs of any device on my controller with bank scrolling; gives me a feedback of every parameter on my phone screen (with associated name and value); basically as close as you can get to push integration. For now I have a novation launchcontrol XL which allow me to have color coded pots with my screen as well. downside is catching the value but with feedback it's perfectly alright. A controller like the twister fighter can solve this issue with encoders.\n\nI also made a mode which can automap an entire synth to the launch control xl in the same way.\n\nThere are many ways of going about it; the [electra one](https://www.electra.one/) does it as well.\n\nI agree with OP that the push is super bulky; and some people like me don't need the pad part; or one or two rows is enough. make a push like this and we'll talk. otherwise it has no place in my everyday workflow; I'll live without the sleek interface.", "ups": 3, "depth": 1, "author": "grrrzzzt", "replies": [{"selftext": "Yeah now that I think about it, the APC might have also done this (switched MIDI mapping when you clicked a new track), but the workflow with banks and managing a line of racks was not convenient.

Having the immediate knowledge of what those knobs were mapped to on the device without having to look at the monitor and being able to see racks further in your line visually.  \n\n\nThat sounds like a pretty good solution you were able to come up with. It would still slightly bother me I think that I still have to focus my vision somewhere besides the knobs to get the information but you can probably get your phone much closer than your monitor that's for sure haha.  \n\n\nA Push Mini would be a great idea.

It has a 2 octave midi keyboard, 8 knobs, and 8 pads that you can use. There are so many little hidden gems in it including an arpeggiator, a scale guide, and a touchpad so you can control X/Y and send data to two sets of CC data. It also has bluetooth capabilities, so you can connect it wirelessly to your computer/laptop - or even your phone/tablet. Admittedly, I haven't used the bluetooth function and definitely wouldn't rely on the bluetooth connectivity to drive your performance. Also, the fact you can then add the nanoKontrol Studio to this is an additional plus. Those two combined will be all you need to create an efficient workflow for both live and studio performances.\n\nAdditionally, anything Arturia will do you well. The MiniLab is the first thing that comes to mind for portable with faders, pads, and keys. It's an incredible little controller and sufficient to run a live performance. The real value for money when buying one of these is the software Arturia include with it. \n\nOthers have mentioned Akai as an alternative and I've used the LPD8 a lot and think it's great. When combined with the LPK25 (keyboard), then you've got a very minimalist portable setup which will allow you to quickly setup a portable workstation in a matter of seconds.

This will result in your finished project being around -6 to -3db peak which you can then use a limiter or whatever to bring the final volume up to 0db. This is just a safe way of doing it IMO. However it's at this point you'll probably soon discover even though your tracks are hitting 0db, they're not as loud as commercial tracks of the same genre. And then the journey into controlling dynamics to get louder mixes begins. This process involves using compression, limiting, saturation and/or other techniques during the production/mixing stages to control peaks and get everything sitting nicely in your mix, without squishing the hell out of it all. All this takes a while to learn though so take your time, learn the tools  and tackle each issue as they arise. I think that's easier than trying to learn a bunch of processes in one sitting. \n\nHope this all makes sense\n\nEdit: rewording for clarity", "ups": 5, "depth": 0, "author": "Valuable-Apricot-477", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "No standardized numbers but there are some standardized rules.

Oh, and the toms should be as loud as the snare since they're normally a fill instrument so then need to be in the forefront when you hear them. Keys I'd say sit slightly under the guitar most times, for more \"Pop\" music they might sit on top of the guitar depending on the song. Also, I'm describing based on the genre you were talking about. Every genre will have a different mix. Also, while all of these are generalities, music is ultimately art and certain art comes down to the artist. I always say though, when creating art, learn how it's done the standard way first and get really good at that, THEN take creative liberties based on your personal taste.

Will these fulfill my live + home producing needs?\n\nFeel free to give tour opinions and suggestions.\n\nThank you very much", "ups": 3, "permalink": "/r/ableton/comments/16s2r3n/confused_on_what_to_buy/", "num_comments": 12}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Just join a band, no one wants to see a solo looping musician", "ups": -5, "depth": 0, "author": "BearzOnParade", "replies": []}, {"selftext": "This is your friendly reminder to read the submission rules, they're found in the sidebar.

Hardware is your thing. Dreams of hardware got me into music also. In fact, the entire reason I have a well paying career was so that I could afford my dreams. There\u2019s something mysterious about the potential of a box. For me, the worst period of my production life was after my friends talked me into selling my mpc (the center of my studio) and focusing on the computer. When I bought it back, my production life took off again and has reached incredible heights in the last 10 years. I\u2019ve had a massive studio over the years. And yes I press records. I actually make and release music. The key relationship to hardware for me was being very willing to sell things that were not working for me. Some gear just doesn\u2019t work with how an individual thinks. \n\nI also own an E4XT. Also a 3200, and an s900. \n\nI say sell the maschine, sell the push, sell the box that should be cool but isn\u2019t working for you. Focus on your dream gear, try it out, sell it for $50 less than you bought it for in a year if it doesn\u2019t work. \n\nBut people participate in music in all kinds of ways. Running blogs, DJing, being a mix engineer, writing, running club nights, buying gear. Often making music isn\u2019t what\u2019s important. So feel free to forget about productivity and chase what excites you. You might just find that the fascination is what you need to make music. Or\u2026 if you just fiddle around, that\u2019s 100% fine. Think of how many people play guitar and are never asked \u201cwhy Arnt you releasing music?\u201d\n\nBuy the gear you love. sell the stuff you don\u2019t and you\u2019ll feel good about it. But really. Do it.\n\nOh and feel free to work as little or as much as you want. I had a huge bought of music stress and pressure I put on myself that caused me to stop music completely for 2 years. When I came back, the passion was back. Now I only work when I really want to. The passion is there when it comes, and the stress doesn\u2019t show up because I can always step away. \n\nSo don\u2019t worry about anything and focus on what you are drawn to.

Sampler and Simpler are tons of more fun to use than an old school sampler that doesn't understand .wav files. I've had several of them and just being able to drag sounds on keys in NN-XT without dealing with SCSI drives and submenus is so much better - and if you open your S5000, you'll see that it's a computer anyway. See https://imgur.com/AQMoTvb and how it says \"Intel i386\"?\n\nIn a lot of cases, those big samplers were used to load big orchestral libraries. In others, to substitute for tape/harddisk recording - if you have vocals, just load 'm in memory and trigger 'm from there, no harddisk recorder needed. You have libraries with vintage synths - and those are just substandard copies of what analog modeling plugins can do. V-Collection sounds infinitely better than some single cycle waveforms from a Minimoog that were run through the sampler's internal filters anyway.\n\nThe trap you can fall into is that you have a folder with 10,000 kick drums and you audition them one by one and hope you strike gold (protip: you won't); and then repeat this for every sound you have. With just 10 kicks on a floppy disk, it's harder - because switching costs effort and effort keeps you from endlessly browsing.\n\nFor big collections of samples, https://www.xlnaudio.com/products/xo or https://algonaut.audio/ is amazing.

We all have an internal baramoter that tells us not when we have too much (as I say I think the second you buy a DAW you reach this point.) But when you get to a point where the gear (HW or SW) is in the way of making stuff with it, that is when things start to break down as you have to over index on learning and whatnot to keep things moving. That could either be due to additional complexity to make hardware all work together, or the time needed to learn the new stuff. That's the point where it's time to jump off and look at getting into what you have. It sounds like you are there because you mention not getting the most of what you have.\n\nIf I was looking for an argument to not buy (which it sounds like you are) then in Push you already have a device that can chop beats old school, but unlike old school samplers, it also has a direct integration with the limitless world of Ableton. What's great about that is you could set it up to mimick the workflow of those old school devices, but with the added advantage of it being already integrated and there would be no messing around connecting and transferring the music.

Use reference tracks and a free metering plugin to measure integrated LUFs during the loudest part of the reference track, and try to match the loudest section of your tune to be in the same ballpark of loudness. Focus on finding a kick and snare sound that CAN get as loud as you need to.

I currently use both logic and maschine for different reasons. I think Ableton will solve my issue of having to switch back and forth between Logic and Maschine. \n\nMy issue is I am torn on whether Standard or Suite is right for me. I have a decent amount of third-party VSTs, so the extra sounds are not a selling point for me. I am mainly concerned about missing out on some of the extra effects and Max for Live. Can anyone shine some light on whether they think Suite would be worth it for me or not?

Interestingly I was in the same boat and decided that I trusted Ableton more on hardware and updating the software since Live is their main rodeo. I should say this is not a dig at NI, but for me their strength is very much is sample libraries and presets.\n\nOne thing I notice with a lot of NI software is that they run the CPU hot quite a lot. It's not the most efficient package, even if the included sounds are generally great. The one big benefit you get with Live is that everything is integrated and so it sips CPU when using internal devices. So by getting Suite, you could find yourself eventually leaning more towards these extra effects and sounds, developing more skills in sound design and mixing, and thus relying less on Komplete and the included sounds there. \n\nIn my case, I wanted Sampler for some sampled instruments that can be had for low cost, and also Wavetable, which for my purposes does everything a wavetable synth needs to. I also find this easier to use than the NI synths which are pretty cryptic. \n\nBut when it comes to samples, NI is great for plug &amp; play sounds. Ableton wants you to learn how to use its racks and so the raw sounds take a little work. For me, I value quick access to good presets over sound design, so I don't technically need the Suite packs, but I enjoy digging into them and seeing how the creators use Abelton in anger.\n\nThe additonal sound packs are nice, but if you have Komplete Standard or more, it's questionable whether you need them. With effects, I find it's a mixed story. There are some very nice NI ones (Replika, Raum etc) but Ableton has plenty of its own especially in the last couple versions (Hybrid Reverb, Echo - only in Suite) and don't forget that CPU point. \n\nI find I use both for different strengths. Komplete for instant access to samples &amp; sample libraries that sound amazing, often venturing into wild territory. Ableton  samples plug the gaps when I can't quite find what I need. And then I'd typically favour Soundtoys and Ableton stock effects before I reach for most of the included effects in Komplete. (But that's just me.)\n\nYou could make a case for either Standard or Suite. If you're prone to options paralysis or just happen to be very happy with Komplete then Standard may work best. If you feel that you want to move away from NI or rely on their software less over time - Suite may be the best move. \n\nNote: the free trial of Ableton appears to have been reduced from 90 to 30 days.", "ups": 4, "depth": 0, "author": "sampletracks", "replies": [{"selftext": "Thank you!

I've always found that in an environment like Logic, something like Maschine feels like a potentially useful workflow enhancement as Logic  is less about that integrated or live control. Ableton takes this so far that the modular nature of it can actually be offputting to some. But once you get your head around it, like you say, Maschine becomes potentially a luxury. You're half a step away from having everything in there.

To create a live set, most producers will recommend you to \"freeze &amp; flatten\" as many sounds as you can. So for me the only thing I don't freeze is my acid track since I need the option to control cutoff and other parameters within the plugin still. If you have atmospherical tracks or synths that you say are good and don't need to be tweaked... right click the whole track, click freeze, it'll take a minute, then right click and hit flatten track. Every device, midi pattern has been rendered and turned into an audio file, optimizing your cpu usage for live performance. (My laptop to perform is far from the cpu power my studio desktop has, and I suppose thats the case for most people)\n\nNow you also have the option to put multiple atmospheres or synth patterns with slightly different tweaked sounds in 1 track. Simply drag the flattened tracks over to the track you want to collect them in. To give u some idea for my live performances I use the following setup:\n\nKick - HiHat - Snare/Clap - Drums - DrumAtmosphere - Atmosphere 1 - Atmosphere 2 - Acid\n\n\nAnd just stack 10 different kicks under each other, same for every other track. \n\nHope this helps! :)", "ups": 2, "depth": 1, "author": "SmokeyProductions", "replies": []}]}, {"selftext": "I think I will switch.

Got a Mac for the real version, got the trial - hated it. Hate the UI, hate how clunky everything is, it all feels so dated, nothing is where I want it to be. Not a fan.\n\nThat sucked because I know some of my fav producers use Logic so it seemed like a logical step, considering some of my own music is intended to be along similar lines.\n\nBut my own use case is different, and dictates what works and doesn't work for me - I'm a full-time musician. All my money is made from music, mostly live performances.\n\nI dabbled with some loop pedals and have an RC-600 right now but that aside, I needed a DAW that would work for me live. Logic completely fails here. Bitwig isn't reliable - on both PC and Mac, I've had Bitwig crash. All plugins crash. It's not even uncommon, but it's completely unacceptable and strikes it off for live work.\n\nReaper is too DIY for me. Not my thing. I like some aspects of it, but I'm a musician, not a software engineer. I don't want to DIY a setup and run around looking for scripts and members of the community who might have created X thing to work or whatnot, that's all a bunch of no thanks.\n\nI own Studio One 5 Artist and don't like it. Felt that was a waste of money ever since I bought it.\n\nAbleton Live on Mac, is where I've been finding my feet. Things work the way I want them to, for the most part. I like how there's a little bit of DIY to it, but not to the point where it's off-putting.\n\nI can create my own looper setups for live acoustic gigs, and while I have to set that up the way I want - at least the looper plugin is there and ready to go. I don't have to try and get some open source thing from GitHub or any other bunch of no thanks. It's all there, in Ableton, all the tools are right there.\n\nI like the way things look (I have dark theme fwiw), I like how it's customisable, fully-featured, easy to understand, and offers plenty of awesome stuff that works. I have experienced 2x crashes and they're both my fault - editing settings on my Nektar Pacer in Chrome, while the Pacer is also being used by Ableton Live.. understandable. \n\nBeyond that, completely stable. Zero issues. Everything just works. \n\nAbleton Live, so far, has been the perfect DAW.

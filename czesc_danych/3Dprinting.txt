{"post": {"title": "Lessons learned regarding the proper disposal of resin printing leftovers.", "subreddit": "3Dprinting", "selftext": "I've been using a resin printer for just under a year now, and I had stored up several gallons of resin water and alcohol in that time and I wanted to have it disposed of properly.  I finally got around to taking it all down to the hazardous waste disposal place in my city, per the instructions of various tutorials I'd watched online. The experience was... educational. The people I was handing the stuff over to were displeased with my stupidity and almost definitely only accepted it out of pity for my ignorance, and I don't think they'd do it again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, here are some notes I thought I'd share:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. To the people who have to handle it, \"household hazardous waste\" means something you can buy at a hardware store. The resins we buy online aren't regulated apparently, so the bottles don't have any helpful information on them which would tell them how to dispose of them properly.\n2. They ESPECIALLY don't like accepting repurposed juice bottles full of unlabeled mystery liquid. The guy gave me a few examples of situations where mixing the wrong things together could produce gasses which could kill him and his crew when they have to pour them out, so I understood his frustration there.\n3. They didn't seem to believe that I'm not a small business, which probably means for stuff like this I'd have to pay whatever the commercial rate is for hazardous waste disposal... Like I said, I think they took pity on me because I was standing there like a confused child.\n4. I live in a city of about 1 million people, so it seems unlikely that I'm the ONLY person who uses a resin printer as a hobby to ever show up there. I sincerely hope people are not dumping this crap down the drain around here.\n5. I think from now on I might let the used alcohol evaporate off in an open container in the sun, so that the resin in it cures and dries and can just be thrown away in the trash. If anybody thinks this is a remarkably stupid idea, please let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "ups": 57, "permalink": "/r/3Dprinting/comments/16qcrov/lessons_learned_regarding_the_proper_disposal_of/", "num_comments": 29}, "replies": [{"selftext": "I have seen posts where people set the clear  bottles in the sun, and let the resin cure, then they filter it, and reuse the alcohol to rinse more prints. or they let it all evaporate\n\n\nI don't own a resin printer (yet) so the posts I see on the rinse liquid disposal confuses me.\n\nI read that...\n\n\n1. the resin is safe once cured.\n2. exposing the rinse liquid to uv light cures the resin.\n3. the raw resin is 'toxic'.\n\nSo....\n\nif the rinse liquid is cured in uv light, it's just dirty/cloudy alcohol? that's not especially dangerous any more is it?\n\nor is the rinse liquid somehow stopping the curing process?", "ups": 30, "depth": 0, "author": "doc_willis", "replies": [{"selftext": "So I've done some tinkering with varying degrees of filthy rinse alcohol, where I put the clear container it was in under my post-curing light to see what happens.\n\nMy impression from it is that the UV doesn't penetrate the liquid well enough to cure 100% of the resin suspended in it, because it takes several rounds of exposing the liquid to UV and straining out the goopy cured resin for it to start to clear up.\n\nThe liquid definitely doesn't stop the curing process - some types of resin are much happier curing while suspended in water for example.

PPG is viscous and needs a little bit of heat (~45C) to dissolve the resin well. Sonicating itself for 20 mins will usually heat the resin up to that anyway. For practical purposes, you can consider it as it does not evaporate. PPG is also gentler on the resin and it won't hurt or crack the parts for more sensitive materials. Once PPG gets saturated after a couple months of use, stick the whole sonicator in the fridge overnight and the resin will precipitate out of solution, and you will get a sludge of resin at the bottom. Decant the top ~80% PPG and you can set it aside to reuse, then scrape the sludge out. You lose a little bit each time you regenerate it but not a lot. Stick the sludge outside and let the sun cute it then toss it in the trash. As others have mentioned, you can squeeze a little bit of solvent out by filtering with a coffee filter, but once you get the hang of separating the sludge, this step will be low-value. PPG is a food additive, and non-toxic. I've gone through at least 50L of resin on my Saturn 2 in the past year (I have 3 DLP printers but use that one the most heavily now) and am still using the same 2 gallons of PPG I bought 2 years ago.\n\nPPG requires a post wash in water. let the parts drip dry for a few mins and shake them off to get as much off the part as possible. I use DI water from work, but tap water is fine. if your water is hard it might leave a little white film on the surface when the water is saturated with PPG. Water will need to be refreshed much more frequently than the PPG, but because it's only going to be residual PPG in water, it should be no problem to dump it down the drain.\n\nWe do a similar process for our industrial SLA machines at my work, except TPM since SLA resins are more viscous and need a slightly more aggressive solvent for washing.\n\nThe only material PPG has not worked well for me is Sunlu's nylon like resin. Haven't tried printing everything, but have used it on 50+ different products from the major brands in Amazon and some of the more niche ones like from BASF.\n\nPlease give a try and share to help save the environment :)", "ups": 3, "depth": 0, "author": "DdotMansa", "replies": [{"selftext": "I have never heard of this approach, but thank you for taking the time to write it up.

I have been  doing some researching and have been looking at the Ender 3 S1 Pro, this seems like the best options for my use cases. As i said at the start of this, i am a complete newbie to the whole world of 3D printers. I am hoping someone here can tell me if the ender 3 S1 pro is a good printer for me or if not, can someone help me pick another one.\nI would also like it to have an auto-levelling print tray and a light to shine down on print although these are not required.\n\nI am in the UK.\n\nMy budget is around \u00a3300 maximum\n\nSpace is an issue, can be no more than 60cm depth and around and 60cm wide .\n\nSome basic assembly is ok but nothing huge (like putting every part together) something around the \u201cdifficulty\u201d of the ender 3 s1 pro\n\nThanks everyone", "ups": 0, "permalink": "/r/3Dprinting/comments/16qtt98/first_3d_printer/", "num_comments": 18}, "replies": [{"selftext": "Stay clear of creality unless you like repairing", "ups": 1, "depth": 0, "author": "Boring_Assignment_33", "replies": [{"selftext": "what bits usually break and need repaired?", "ups": 1, "depth": 1, "author": "Financial_Fly3675", "replies": [{"selftext": "They aren't any worse than most other brands I've had.

Those are main types of firmware used in 3d printers. The main difference is that marlin runs directly on printer's processing unit and does all calculations there , so it's limited to relatively weak MicroController computing power, while Klipper is using printer's MicroController only to drive printer's components and all calculations are done on external, much more powerful, processing unit. This allows for much better acceleration, speed and precision, plus a bunch of advanced features.", "ups": 1, "depth": 4, "author": "Immortal_Tuttle", "replies": [{"selftext": "So with klipper, does that mean that my computer is doing more work to be able to do all the calculations?", "ups": 1, "depth": 5, "author": "Financial_Fly3675", "replies": [{"selftext": "No. Neptune 4 has this processing unit built in. From user perspective there is not much difference - you are sending gcode to the printer. \n\nWith Marlin you have one microcontroller doing all the things - from interpreting gcode to driving motors . The problem is those microcontrollers are weak. You will very fast hit their limit if you will try to increase printing speed. \n\nWith Klipper you have two processing units - one for just driving the motors etc and another one (much more powerful) doing gcode interpreting and sending processed data to the driver microcontroller.", "ups": 2, "depth": 6, "author": "Immortal_Tuttle", "replies": [{"selftext": "Oh ok that makes more sense, do you know how quiet it is?", "ups": 1, "depth": 7, "author": "Financial_Fly3675", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}

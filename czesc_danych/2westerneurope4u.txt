{"post": {"title": "Why EU still needs UK more than UK needs EU after Brexit", "subreddit": "2westerneurope4u", "selftext": " The European Union still desperately needs the United Kingdom! Who would have thought that after all the Brexit drama, the EU would be left longing for that British charm? Here are some compelling reasons why the EU simply can't live without its ex-partner in crime:\n\n**Economic Finesse:**\n\nThe UK's economy is like a fine-tuned watch \u2013 it may tick a bit differently from the rest of Europe, but it still tells time. In a bold move post-Brexit, the British Pound has decided to rebrand itself as the \"Brextrillion,\" a currency so strong it can buy you a pint and a bag of crisps without making you broke. To stimulate the economy, the UK government has introduced a new policy: \"Buy One Big Ben, Get a Mini Cooper Free!\" Shoppers are delighted, even if they have no idea where to put a giant clock.\n\n**The Migrant Mayhem:**\n\nThe UK's migrant crisis is a bit like a tea party gone awry. As immigrants attempt to cross the English Channel in everything from rubber ducks to inflatable castles, the Royal Navy has turned its ships into floating tea dispensers. Migrants are welcomed with a hot cuppa and an invitation to a cricket match before they're gently escorted back to France. After all, nothing says \"British hospitality\" like offering tea to sea travelers.\n\n **The Mighty Military:**\n\nThe British military is known for its stoic professionalism, dashing uniforms, and, of course, the infamous \"Well-Armed Teapot.\" This teapot, designed to brew the strongest of British breakfast teas, doubles as a missile launcher in times of crisis. The UK has mastered the art of diplomacy by offering tea to adversaries, and if that doesn't work, they remind them that the teapot can brew destruction as well as Earl Grey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Culinary Wonders:**\n\nBritish cuisine has long been misunderstood, but the UK is on a mission to change that. The culinary world was shocked when they discovered that Brits do, in fact, eat more than just fish and chips. Now, with the \"Great British Food Revolution\" in full swing, the UK is unveiling culinary masterpieces like \"Spotted Dick\" and \"Bubble and Squeak\" to an unsuspecting world. Tourists flock to the UK to sample these exotic delights, and restaurants are offering a \"Brexit Breakfast\" featuring baked beans, black pudding, and fried toast \u2013 a feast that'll keep you full for a whole week.", "ups": 9, "permalink": "/r/2westerneurope4u/comments/16p99av/why_eu_still_needs_uk_more_than_uk_needs_eu_after/", "num_comments": 65}, "replies": [{"selftext": "aha", "ups": 46, "depth": 0, "author": "DieBunteMango", "replies": [{"selftext": "Tja", "ups": 16, "depth": 1, "author": "Doberkind", "replies": [{"selftext": "Hm", "ups": 13, "depth": 2, "author": "The_Sceptic_Lemur", "replies": [{"selftext": "So so", "ups": 11, "depth": 3, "author": "Expert_Repair4206", "replies": [{"selftext": "ja dann", "ups": 7, "depth": 4, "author": "Afura33", "replies": [{"selftext": "Ach so", "ups": 6, "depth": 5, "author": "High_Bird", "replies": [{"selftext": "ja gut", "ups": 6, "depth": 6, "author": "Afura33", "replies": [{"selftext": "Danke Merkel", "ups": 3, "depth": 7, "author": "OtdoorPhilosophy", "replies": [{"selftext": "Ist aber ne Sch\u00f6ne wa", "ups": 3, "depth": 8, "author": "Afura33", "replies": [{"selftext": "Hmmmm puuuhhh....", "ups": 3, "depth": 9, "author": "Meraun86", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"selftext": "Mind your own business.

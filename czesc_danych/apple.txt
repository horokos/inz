We like to watch Star Wars or Marvel together via the Disney app. It was fine before when the native Disney app handled things. \n\nBut now it\u2019s not a great experience to watch together via SharePlay. \n\n1. Nobody wants a window of their loved ones on top of the show. (In Apple tv I couldn\u2019t figure out how to hide it)\n\n2. Nobody wants the camera on and staring at them while they watch a show. (It\u2019s on by default and it\u2019s annoying to have to fuss with the remote to turn it off) \n\n3. Audio is on by default and you can hear the other person\u2019s audio through your speakers. Yes I have AirPods, but I also have a home theater audio setup that I prefer. Again, muting my outgoing audio is annoying to have to navigate to. \n\nBottom line: \nI know there are some workarounds but it was clunky, awkward, and a massive step back from our old experience. \n\nWe cancelled the SP session. Then watched on our own and just texted \u201c3\u20262\u20261\u2026 go\u201d \n\nI want to like the feature.

Not sure if this warrants a whole thread so mods feel free to take down, but right off the heels of iCloud+ expanding their storage options to 6TB and 12TB, I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on this. As a data hoarder, while the idea of cloud storage is great, how iCloud+ puts it into practice isn't exactly ideal for *me* because of the inability to control what gets downloaded/stored locally on devices (my MacBook Pro) and what doesn't.\n\nFor me, my ideal use of a high capacity storage option iCloud+ is to store all of my media back ups from SD cards etc and have a safe space for it in the event that I lose the physical media. But the problem is, I don't want said media to randomly be downloaded onto my MacBook just because it has the available local space. And inversely, the media that I *do* want locally, I don't want iCloud to remove it just because I haven't touched it in a few days.\n\nWith that said, if you are upgrading to a 6TB or 12TB option because you need to space, how are you using the iCloud+ storage service in general?

I can easily access/share my files wherever there is data, scan docs within the app directly into a folder, have a personal vault, and I can backup my iPhone photos/vids directly to OneDrive as I take them. On my PC I always turn on the option to automatically download new synced files locally, and there's never a problem with it or file syncs.

Not all the banking apps are able to keep track of subscriptions, which can make things difficult when subscribed to a number of services at once and suddenly being charged without any warning. When I was looking for a subscription management app, most of them required purchase of the premium tier (or even a subscription!) to track more than 5 subscriptions at once, and some have a limited number of currencies. There was room for something better, and that's what led to me creating SubManager.\n\nRecently I have launched version 1.1, which introduces full Apple Watch support, just in time for watchOS 10 launching tomorrow. The new watch app makes use of watchOS 10 UI elements and lets you view your subscriptions on your wrist.

{"post": {"title": "Do NOT buy Amazon renewed Apple devices.", "subreddit": "apple", "selftext": "A couple of months ago, I decided to buy a refurbished \"excellent quality\" Iphone 12 from Amazon renewed with their \"guarantee\" that the phone would be in perfect order. This is my personal horrible experience with buying refurbished Apple phones from Amazon.\n\nEven before I had opened the package, I was greeted with my first red flag of the entire Amazon renewed experience. The box looked shady, was beat up, and was shipped from a very far away warehouse. It was not well packed and contained  the phone and several accessories. At first glance, the phone looked great and seemed to have no defects. This is where the first in a long string of issues came in. As I went to power on the phone, all the buttons were mushy and unresponsive, as if someone had coated them in honey. Upon further inspection, they were filled with dirt and sand and looked as if they had been stuffed full of mud. I spent over an hour cleaning and recleaning the phone's buttons with rubbing alcohol and a swab and managed to get the buttons unstuck enough so that I could use the phone. I sent a very angry message to the seller and posted a 1-star review. A few days later I received a reply from them essentially \"buying me off\", telling me to delete the review and that I would receive 20$. As the phone seemed in good condition otherwise, and I really just wanted the whole ordeal out of the way, I accepted. They proceeded to send me message after message reminding me to delete the review and pestering me day and night (they were sending me these messages on my personal Whatsapp). After deleting the review I figured I was done with the ordeal and vowed to not buy another renewed phone as long as I lived (After deleting a seller review you cannot post another one FYI). Now we get to another big red flag. The first day I unlocked the phone the battery health stood at a great 95%. I was ecstatic at receiving such great battery health. I would continue to check the battery health every few days to satisfy my OCD and did not like what I saw. The battery health dropped several percent in a single week. I read up on Apple's blogs that it was meant to lose a few percent per year, and here I was losing 4% in just 3 weeks. Again, I sent a message to the seller, questioning about the battery health and they assured me that it was \"simply readjusting to the proper reading\" and to \"not worry about it\". I nearly returned the phone right then and there but decided against it because \"hey, 91% battery health is almost as good as 95% right?\". Now comes the final issue and the reason I am making this post. As I was sitting in bed on my phone, I noticed that the screen kept changing brightness and tone. I hoped that it was a software bug and restarted my phone. I was greeted with the \"green screen of death\" and immediately knew the phone was toast. Try as I would with changing the brightness, restarting the phone, etc. The screen would not go back to functioning. I immediately contacted the seller and requested a refund and here we are. Needed to vent some repressed frustration so I decided to make this post. Will update based on what they say.\n\nTL;DRBought a renewed phone from Amazon that had many red flags and issues and ultimately broke after only a few months. The Seller was shady and \"bought me off\" essentially paying me to remove my negative review before the phone stopped working.\n\nThis may not be accurate to or represent everyone's experience with it (hopefully not). I only wanted to vent and give a word of warning to potential Amazon renewed buyers.\n\nEdit:  \nYES I know this was all my fault. If you're wondering what the seller said after I contacted them, apperantly the damage is \"my fault\" because of \"damage to the retina display\". Total BS. I never dropped the phone or damaged it in the slightest.

I do two additional methods of hiding my main email, plus set up rules in Mail.app to handle breaches.\n\nFirst up, create aliases. This means you can create an entirely separate email address that still funnels into your main inbox and can send/receive emails like a normal email. I have a fakename@icloud.com email that gets used for all online accounts. If that email ever gets compromised in any way, I can simply delete the email alias and start new. But of a pain in the ass, but at least it saves your real email.\n\nSide note, that\u2019s all \u201chide my email\u201d is doing. It\u2019s creating an alias email that only responds to the site you used it on. Even if that email is sold, I think Apple just blocks the incoming spam.\n\nNow onto my second method. iCloud accepts the \u201c+\u201d tag in an email for routing purposes. So, when you have youremail@icloud.com, you can use youremail+reddit@icloud.com as your login here. From Reddit\u2019s point of view, that\u2019s your full email. If anyone else emails you at that email, you\u2019ll know Reddit sold your email. This happened to me with Canva actually\u2014 a completely different company emailed myemail+canva@icloud.com, so I knew the data had been shared. A warning here though, not all websites will accept a + character in the email field, so you\u2019ll have to fall back on an alias in those instances. Plus one of the bigger drawbacks, you can\u2019t send emails using the + tag: it will only be able to receive.\n\nTake it a step further. You can combine your alias and the + tag to now have a unique email per site. So fakename+reddit@icloud.com will route directly into your inbox without reddit knowing a single detail about your real email. Even if someone finds that email and knows to just remove the +reddit portion, they still only have your alias email at that point.\n\nThis is about the time I recommend a password manager. You\u2019ll have a separate email for every login in theory, so that\u2019s a lot to remember on top of a password for each. Personal favorite is 1Password, they\u2019ve been doing it the longest. All of these unique emails will be tough to manage, and it\u2019s harder to recover a forgotten email than a forgotten password when you\u2019re implementing the above.\n\nLastly, let\u2019s say Reddit sells your fakename+reddit@icloud.com email info to another company; Walmart just for example. Number one, shame on them. Number two, you can set up a rule in your email app that says \u201call emails addressed to fakename+reddit@icloud.com and from Walmart \u2192 delete immediately.\u201d These rules sort of depend on what email app you\u2019re using as some are more robust than others, but you get the idea.\n\nAs a bonus, if you\u2019re ever skeptical about signing up for an account on a website and want to test it out first, you can use a burner email online.
